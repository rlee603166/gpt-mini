Rather, it trains students to utilize internal accounting in strategic decision making with an aim to improving profitability and efficiency. Most employers expect leading business school candidates to have a high aptitude for understanding, performing and applying financial analyses, including cost analyses. Pricing decisions require cost analyses. Corporate finance is responsible for the firms financial reporting and control systems. Investment banks and consulting firms sell their services to clients, on the ability of their personnel to do careful, comprehensive financial analyses. Managing and motivating people in organizations involve developing appropriate performance measures. ACC 221 teaches you how to apply economics, coupled with the firms accounting system, to make decisions and motivate people in organizations.Prerequisite: ACC201** If the section is full, please request the course here on UR Student and then email ugbusiness@rochester.edu to be added to the waitlist.

The goal of the course is to decipher the different functions of fantasy, both the good and the bad: a cathartic separation from lived struggle or a cultural tool that encourages fear and disgust towards difference in gender, religion, race, and sexuality. What makes fantasy and depicting the fantastic so compelling that it persists and evolves across history, geographies, and cultures? This course will provide an introduction to visual studies and art history and include a required research paper.

Both the historical and archaeological record demonstrates the city is not a new phenomenon, but scholars debate over what actually constitutes a city, especially in the prehispanic Americas. To this end, we will read key texts about cities and urbanism that will help us better understand this debate.

They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dante's concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology. A visual component, including illustrations of the 'Comedy' and multiple artworks pertinent to the narrative, complements the course.

This emissary carried with him an illustrated narrative scroll from Goshirakawa\u2019s own secret collection. The shogun, however, dared not even glance at the contents and ordered its immediate return. Japan\u2019s celebrated tradition of graphic storytelling can in part trace its roots to a culture of illustrated narrative that began in the 8th century. This course introduces students to illustrated narrative scrolls and other forms of visual and performative culture from the late classical through the early modern period with reference to modern manifestations of Japan\u2019s ongoing visual culture. Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image. In considering how illustrated scrolls developed and matured as a Japanese art form, we will dare to look where Japan\u2019s first shogun did not, and in so doing, come to understand his refusal to do so\u2014and something of our own desire to view and be viewed.

By contrast, when the English crashed into their own unseen continent a century later, they landed in the\u00a0arctic, and found, to some extent,\u00a0nothing.\u00a0Icy, unpopulated, commodity- poor, visually and temporally \u201cabstract,\u201d the Far North - a different kind of\u00a0terra incognita\u00a0for the early modern imagination than the sun-drenched Indies, offered no clear\u00a0stuff\u00a0to be seen or exploited. With this, this seminar contends, the\u00a0Arctic\u00a0quietly yet powerfully challenged older narratives of world- and picture-making. Neither a continent, nor an ocean, nor a meteorological circumstance, the\u00a0Arctic\u00a0forced explorers, writers, and early artists from England, the Netherlands, and Germany to grapple with a different kind of \u201cecology.\u201d Here, there were virtually no exotic animals, teeming forests, or enchanting civilizations to study, exploit, or exterminate - yet. In the frigid North, that is, the idea of description as a kind of accumulative endeavor of \u201crepresentation\u201d - of exoticism as synonymous with abundance - was thrown into question; the North was unsettling not because of dazzling difference, but because of monotonous sameness. Rather than an Eden, to Renaissance travelers the\u00a0arctic\u00a0was something like the moon."

Since Deleuze, folding has been understood as riposte to fixed thinkings of here/there, present/nonpresent, being/nonbeing, long dominant in Western philosophy. Departing from this idea, and its vitality as a universal differentiator, this course hopes to explore the fold\u2019s extensions into other philosophical motifs, and probe its conceptual intersections with art history. Our objects are diverse: German diptychs, Japanese fans, the first ever folded letters, etc. Readings will follow two threads: One weaves through the theoretical discussions on, but not restricted to, the concepts of continuum, repetition, (in)finity, (in)visibility, event, tableau(x), and depth(s). The second surveys the art historical interpretations of folds\u2019 representation and materiality, scattered across regions and cultures, and draws particular attention to the distinct apprehensions of artworks acting as the \u201cthinking objects\u201d and \u201cpensive images\u201d that philosophize folds.

We will examine Foucault\u2019s major works, such as Madness and Civilization, The Order of Things, and Discipline and Punish, the interviews and essays of Power/Knowledge, as well as selections from the recently published Coll\u00e8ge de France lectures, to understand his profound effect on the ethical and political transformations of \u201cTheory\u201d or \u201cCritical Theory.\u201d We will also examine Foucault\u2019s thought in relation to prominent philosophers and critics, including Judith Butler, Derrida, Rorty, Habermas, and Hayden White.

    "title": "Arctic Vision",
    "description": "When Spanish and Portuguese explorers stumbled upon a sunny \"America\" that was new to them, they encountered balmy wonders \u2013 armadillos, cities, and gold. By contrast, when the English crashed into their own unseen continent a century later, they landed in the\u00a0arctic, and found, to some extent,\u00a0nothing.\u00a0Icy, unpopulated, commodity- poor, visually and temporally \u201cabstract,\u201d the Far North - a different kind of\u00a0terra incognita\u00a0for the early modern imagination than the sun-drenched Indies, offered no clear\u00a0stuff\u00a0to be seen or exploited. With this, this seminar contends, the\u00a0Arctic\u00a0quietly yet powerfully challenged older narratives of world- and picture-making. Neither a continent, nor an ocean, nor a meteorological circumstance, the\u00a0Arctic\u00a0forced explorers, writers, and early artists from England, the Netherlands, and Germany to grapple with a different kind of \u201cecology.\u201d Here, there were virtually no exotic animals, teeming forests, or enchanting civilizations to study, exploit, or exterminate - yet. In the frigid North, that is, the idea of description as a kind of accumulative endeavor of \u201crepresentation\u201d - of exoticism as synonymous with abundance - was thrown into question; the North was unsettling not because of dazzling difference, but because of monotonous sameness. Rather than an Eden, to Renaissance travelers the\u00a0arctic\u00a0was something like the moon."

    "title": "The Fold",
    "description": "This course thinks about the fold as a form, a material, and a metaphor in art.\u00a0 How do actions of folding (paper, hands, altarpieces, screens, poker) affect counter-forces and time-spaces resisting or subverting the dynamism of a \u201cstable\u201d artwork? Since Deleuze, folding has been understood as riposte to fixed thinkings of here/there, present/nonpresent, being/nonbeing, long dominant in Western philosophy. Departing from this idea, and its vitality as a universal differentiator, this course hopes to explore the fold\u2019s extensions into other philosophical motifs, and probe its conceptual intersections with art history. Our objects are diverse: German diptychs, Japanese fans, the first ever folded letters, etc. Readings will follow two threads: One weaves through the theoretical discussions on, but not restricted to, the concepts of continuum, repetition, (in)finity, (in)visibility, event, tableau(x), and depth(s). The second surveys the art historical interpretations of folds\u2019 representation and materiality, scattered across regions and cultures, and draws particular attention to the distinct apprehensions of artworks acting as the \u201cthinking objects\u201d and \u201cpensive images\u201d that philosophize folds. We will investigate the conditions, methods, and challenges of current scholarship, and reflect on the issues of how to write about folds across disciplines."

Second, it will introduce students to urban anthropology and in particular, to scholarship which examines the politics of urban restructuring (including urban renewal, gentrification, urban violence, deindustrialization, and other topics). Reading ethnographies that document struggles over space in the US and abroad, we will investigate different constellations of power, inequality, and resistance - - and how anthropologists study them.

This course introduces students to the key concepts, debates, and theories in the studies of aging. Using ethnographic cases in the Unites States, China, and other contexts, we will explore how economic, social, structural, and cultural factors shape the experiences and practices of aging. We will discuss connections between early-life experiences and later-life health and well-being. We will interrogate the assumptions and stereotypes about aging, the economic and intergenerational impacts of aging, common diseases and functional problems, and what roles family and community members play. Because of the multi-faceted nature of aging, this course will touch on a range of other important issues in medical anthropology as well, including care, chronic illness, mental health, and disability. Class materials include contemporary readings, films, documentaries, video clips, and newspaper articles. In addition to developing an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of aging studies, students will have a chance to learn ethnographic methods and conduct first-hand research on the cultural aspects of aging in their own communities."

It provides an overview of a broad range of key topics, theoretical approaches, and research methods in this rapidly expanding sub-field. Apart from exploring the medical systems of other cultures, we will reflect on biomedicine as a cultural artifact. How do patients and health professionals understand and experience states of health and illness? How is the body socially and culturally constructed? How do ideas, practices, and material artifacts of medicine shape our understandings of each other and ourselves as particular kinds of persons? What lies at the intersection of health, racism, poverty, and other social inequalities? How can we think of health care differently by looking at alternative visions of care in other places? Key topics covered include cultural interpretations of sickness and healing, social determinants of health, iatrogenesis, global epidemics, addiction, care, and the training of medical professionals. This course is meant to help students have a better grasp of the major concepts and theoretical approaches in medical anthropology, and enable students to interrogate their own beliefs and experiences of sickness and bodies, as well as the causes of human suffering and vulnerabilities."

    "description": "Mental illness (or madness) has long been of interest to sociocultural, medical, and psychological anthropologists, in part because it can serve as a lens through which to understand difference or deviance across and within societies. In this course we will explore the ways mental illness is understood and experienced across different cultural contexts. We will begin with the long-standing anthropological insight that culture shapes how persons experience and respond to illness. In particular, given the proliferation of biological models of mental illness in our contemporary world, we will examine psychiatry as a culture of its own: we will explore how \u2018psy\u2019 knowledge is created and how they transform over time and space; how persons inhabit or are made to inhabit diagnostic categories; and how various social actors experiment with diagnostic categories and therapeutic practices\u2014such as psychopharmaceuticals, religious and spiritual rituals, and psychotherapy. Additionally, our survey of the literature considers social epidemiology, looking at the intersections of psychic distress and various social identities\u2014such as gender, life-stage transitions, class, race, and immigration status. Thus, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of mind and mental illness as shaped by both cultural contexts and social structures, enriching anthropological theories of subjectivity and psychiatric theories of mental illness and mental health."

We will examine how knowledge is produced and travels in ways we might consider non-normative and the effects that these forms of mediation have in the world, shaping subjectivities, forms of political mobilization, and their mutual relationships.\u00a0The first part of the course analyzes some of the broader social conditions that shape the possibility of knowledge\u2014the mediated quality of social life, the role of ideological and affective formations, and some of the blind spots that shape our modes of perception and sense-making. It also touches on some of the subtle forms of violence that permeate social worlds. The second part looks at the social lives of different \u201cgenres\u201d of non-normative knowledge\u2014including secrecy, spectacle, rumor, and conspiracy theory. We explore how these forms of knowledge travel, the kinds of affective dispositions attached to them, what notions of and relations to power they presuppose, how they seek to overcome or sustain uncertainty, and how they relate to normative forms of knowledge production. We finish the course by looking at a distinct set of genres of knowledge production and circulation\u2014such as parody, humor, and fiction\u2014and their creative modes of power subversion."

Why do we celebrate some urban wildlife while ignoring, reviling, and even exterminating others? This introduction to the interdisciplinary field of animal studies addresses these and other questions through recent scholarship on multispecies cities. The first part of the course surveys urban human-animal ecology from domestication to enclosure with an emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. In the second part, we ponder contemporary studies of interspecies contact, collision, and cohabitation, from macaques in Delhi and mosquitos in Dar es Salaam to capybaras in Buenos Aires and parakeets in London. Students will gain an understanding of the historical forces that have shaped everyday encounters with nonhuman animals, particularly as they concern matters of violence, intimacy, and justice.

    "description": "This is an introductory course in Islamic art and architectural history. The course explores dynastic art and monumental architecture across vast lands between Spain and India and the seventh to the thirteenth centuries. One of the main goals of this course is to practice how to see things, make relevant questions to those things, and find possible answers. To accomplish this objective, this course situates significant works of visual, material culture, and built environment within the relevant historical and geographical contexts to which they belonged. Students are expected to both see the world of Islamic art from an interpretive perspective and gain general knowledge of cultural contexts outside of America and Europe."

    "description": "While many of us may or may not live in cities today, their presence as central places for administrative, judicial, and social purposes is undeniable. Both the historical and archaeological record demonstrates the city is not a new phenomenon, but scholars debate over what actually constitutes a city, especially in the prehispanic Americas. To this end, we will read key texts about cities and urbanism that will help us better understand this debate. We will also discuss how recent anthropological approaches to studying cities have helped archaeologists better understand prehispanic urbanism and city-life."

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; interaction techniques for AR/VR systems; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education & professional training. In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

    "description": "The objective of the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition is to design and build an engineered biological system using DNA technologies over the course of the summer. iGEM projects aim to solve local, real-world problems, for example by engineering bacteria that can break down plastic waste. You will design your own experiments, construct new genetic parts, and validate the constructs using new characterization assays. In addition to the wet-lab research, iGEM involves mathematical modeling to predict the behavior and guide the design of the new biological parts and characterization assays. Students also design, construct, characterize, and improve their own piece of hardware that will work together with the designed biological organism. The policy and practice component addresses the social, legal, and ethical issues of the project. iGEM is multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, and student-managed. You will travel to Boston and interact with 300 universities from all over the world."

You will develop a technical vocabulary and set of skills that allow you to describe recurring patterns and writer choices within those patterns. Using these tools, and talking to experts in your chosen discipline(s), you will investigate disciplinary and interdisciplinary boundaries, how writers convey meaning in different situations, and why they make the writing choices they do. Through a final research project of your choice, you will practice using what you have learned to communicate the results of your own research. This course is especially suitable for dual-major students, or those heading to graduate or health professions schools. Courses in the WRTG 27X series may not be taken more than once for credit."

    "description": "In this course, we will explore both the science of poisonous substances and their impact on human history and culture. What is a poison? Where can poisons be found in nature? Who discovered them, and how? Focusing on small molecule poisons, we will study the chemical and biochemical mechanisms underlying their toxicity and discuss how antidotes work. Through case studies, we will examine the wide variety of uses people have found for these compounds, from committing crimes to practicing medicine. Source materials will include historical, literary, and scientific texts, recent essays, and popular culture. Prerequisite: completion of two semesters of organic chemistry."

    "title": "Introduction to Black Studies",
    "description": "This course invites you to learn about Black history, life, and experience through the field of Black Studies. During the 1960s, a wave of student activism \u2014 amid a period marked by broader social activism, Black freedom struggle, and decolonial movements \u2014 echoed across the United States. Legacies of chattel slavery, colonialism, and racial capitalism were being challenged in all edges of American society. Through sit-ins, strikes, and protests, activists along with community members and organizers sought to compel colleges and universities to recognize the importance of studying Black life, history, and culture. This grassroots movement laid the foundation which led to the formation of Black Studies as a field across campuses.\u00a0This course will begin by first establishing a shared understanding of Black Studies, including its historical origins and key theories, concepts, methods, and debates. We then draw on insights that span the humanities and social sciences, including literature, popular culture, music and\u00a0engagement with cultural studies, history, political theory, and ethnography. Ultimately, we will bridge the historical and contemporary, exploring how insights from Black Studies are essential for addressing present-day challenges and struggles for justice."

In addition to well-known modes of music making, we will look at many fascinating but less familiar forms of musical expression, such as aboriginal pop music from Australia, the throat-singing traditions of Tuva and Mongolia, and the freedom songs of South Africa. The course will culminate in a semester-long final project."

The course interprets this tradition not only as the creative expression of American writers of African descent, but also as a set works displaying formal characteristics associated with black cultural traditions. Discussion topics will include the meanings of race, the construction of black identity, and intra-racial differences of class, gender, and sexuality, as well as how experimentation, 1960s black radicalism, and the contemporary Movement for Black Lives have shaped black literature. Our readings will traverse a range of influential writers, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Nella Larsen, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, Claudia Rankine, and Danez Smith."

There is a crisis, and this course introduces students to the predicament, arguing that since the first Industrial Revolution in England, the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East have refashioned their destinies in partnership with the West. Students will examine how the following encounters helped make the region as we know it: the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1838, transition from Ottoman to West European colonialism, discovery of huge and easily extractable oil reserves, creation of the state of Israel, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and the US Invasion of Iraq in 2003.

    "title": "Black Visual Culture",
    "description": "In 1903 when Du Bois wrote that the \u201cproblem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\u201d early cinema and photography were already well-established technologies shaping discourses of race and the boundaries between black and white. In this course we will examine the relationship between visual culture and race, particularly blackness. We will ask the following questions: What is the relationship between visuality and modern understandings of race? How does visual culture shape perceptions of race and racialized bodies? After establishing the historical context, we will consider how contemporary artists from the African diaspora imagine blackness otherwise by playing with, challenging, and subverting overdetermined stereotypes of blackness. We will explore this subject matter by examining the visual and performance art practices of black filmmakers, photographers, curators, fine artists, etc. Potential artists include Spike Lee, Kara Walker, Kehinde Whiley, Mary Sibande, Athi-Patra Ruga, Wangechi Mutu, Grace Jones, Josephine Baker, Cheryl Dunye, Isaac Julien, Beyonc\u00e9, and Rihanna. This course will introduce students to a range of historical and contemporary debates that inform the theory and practice of Black Visual Culture."

    "description": "What does the life history of Esteban the Moor tell us about contact and conflict among Africans and Indigenous peoples during the \u201cconquest\u201d of the Americas? How do the Garifuna and the Miskito peoples of Central America differ in their emphasis on their Blackness and their indigeneity? What does it mean to be Black and/or indigenous in the Latin America? How are the two marginalized groups constructed in relation to each other? We will explore these questions and more in Zambaje: Afro-Indigenous Relations in Latin AmericaThis course takes a broad approach to relationships between indigenous and Afro-descendant populations in Latin America. It begins in the colonial moment, exploring the tensions and solidarities between the two groups of people. It explores Afro-Indigenous populations and their position in the colonial and nationalist moments. It then examines questions of identity, recognition, sovereignty, conflict, and erasure into the present. Some key concepts we will unpack include: mixture and separation; competitions and solidarities; slavery and freedom; ethnicity and race; and collective rights."

    "description": "While peoples of African descent have existed in Latin America since Europeans arrived in this hemisphere, their recognition has been uneven, contingent, and contested across the region. Now that the United Nations Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) has ended, it is worthwhile to reflect on the symbolic and material differences Afro-Latin Americans have experienced based on this concerted effort to recognize them. How does the state see them? What does it mean to be seen?In this course, we will contextualize and analyze contemporary efforts to see and be seen as Afro-Latin Americans. In the process we will grapple with questions like: Is \u201cBlack\u201d in Latin America a race or an ethnicity? What\u2019s the difference? How do you create, maintain, and demand collective identity and rights? In a region where racial mixture has occurred for centuries and is part of its nation-building, who counts as Afro-descendant? In this course, we will grapple with these questions and more as we contextualize and analyze contemporary efforts toward the political recognition of Afro-Latin Americans."

    "description": "Africa\u2019s engagement with China has to be read as a two-sided story: China has found in Africa a reliable supplier of natural resources while Africans look to China for aid and investments in agriculture, industry, infrastructure, and education. And, in a significant departure from the colonial model of economic interactions, Chinese companies do not only ship finished products to Africa; they also manufacture in Africa goods for internal use and for export. The impact of these multifaceted relations will not be decided in Beijing alone, as many assume in the West; the outcome will also depend on the decisions taken in African capitals."

    "description": "What does the form of music theatre teach us about the conditions of Black life? Engaging this inquiry, this course is a comprehensive survey of Black music theatre from the nineteenth century to the present. Borrowing approaches from performance theory, sound studies, Black cultural studies (from Black feminist, queer, and trans perspectives), and music/musicology, we will read and listen to various scripts and scores across genres in music theatre including traditional musicals, operas, dance, film, and performance art. Additionally, this course decenters Broadway as music theatre\u2019s centerpiece, instead looking to the ways Black music theatre emerged in Black communities through nightclubs, the vaudeville circuit, churches, and other community centers. We look at hugely popular works such as Shuffle Along, Porgy and Bess, Dreamgirls, The Wiz, and A Strange Loop to more lesser-known musicals by under-studied artists such as Micki Grant, Vinnette Carroll, Jeff Augustin, Stew, and more. The course will also include artistic development in songwriting and musical storytelling, with guest lectures from working artists in professional music theatre. Taken together, we consider the politics, forms, and aesthetics of Black music theatre as both critiques of anti-Black structures and rehearsals for Black futurity."

    "title": "Ancient Slavery and Modern Abolition",
    "description": "Political and moral ideals from the ancient Mediterranean World played an important role in shaping the character of political and social institutions in the colonial and post-colonial United States. Slaveholders justi\ufb01ed the practice of slavery in America based in part on their own interpretation of ancient Roman and Greek models and ideologies of slavery. Both as a reaction to this pro-slavery use of ancient allusions and also because of the 19th century cultural value of Classical education and the authority of ancient examples, many American abolitionist thinkers, politicians, and activists also incorporated ancient examples and ideals into their own anti-slavery arguments. This course will explore the in\ufb02uence of the ancient\u00a0Mediterranean world on the expression and evolution of abolitionist activities and political thought, with a particular focus on the rich local anti-slavery history of Western New York and the city of Rochester, in particular, as an important site of abolitionist political activity. We will examine primary sources from the ancient world and the 18th and 19th centuries and consider the role of ideas about the ancient world as it relates to modern slavery and the movement to abolish it in the United States."

    "description": "Monsters in popular culture represent and reinforce the changing thoughts and emotions toward what it means to be human and fit for society. When it comes to race, gender, and sexuality, popular culture has often used monsters to destroy or discipline individuals who live outside societal norms. This is called the making of\u00a0black monstrosity. This course takes this historical trend seriously, diving into the ways monsters have been used to harm Black people, but also how notions of the\u00a0black monster\u00a0has been deployed as tool of revolt against unjust society. Turning to case studies, primarily within the twenty-first century--from visual black monstrosity in cinema, animation, digital art, and comics\u2014we will explore how a certain monster-imaginary contributes to the discourse and perception of race and racialized bodies in America."

In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

The exploration will require that students grapple in depth issues: defining questions, evaluating evidence, weighing arguments, reflecting on epistemological issues, constructing new experiments, etc. The study of organic chemistry will be carefully integrated with a review of the key concepts from general chemistry. The CHM171/172 sequence is designed for first year students with good preparation in chemistry (2 yrs of gen chem & AP score of 4 or 5). This sequence fast tracks students to more advanced chemistry courses and the fulfillment of degree requirements in other disciplines. Coregistration required in the accompanying lab - CHM208 or CHM210(W). CHM210W is recommended for CHM majors. Lab fee will be billed. (Spring)."

Non-linear dynamics (and thermodynamics) \u00a0are shown as foundations of complex behavior of chemical, biological and environmental processes. The evolution of multi-component systems \u00a0to ever increasing complexity, modeled in terms of multiple interactions, is guided by local dynamical equilibrium and environmental constraints. Thus, multiple collisions governed by classical deterministic forces are shown to result in a host of thermodynamic phenomena, such as the kinetic gas laws, the three main Laws of Thermodynamics, establishment of equilibrium in chemical \u00a0reactions and between different material phases, solvation and mixing, as well as transport of energy by mass flow. Since most of the laboratory or natural processes involving transformation of materials and energy rely on some basic quantum mechanical properties of microscopic organization, some quantum statistical principles are also reviewed in the course.

    "description": "(4 credits, Fall, Spring) Chemistry 252 covers thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and chemical kinetics. These subjects provide a fundamental understanding of the behavior of matter and energy. The focus of the class is on both Thermodynamics, which is the mathematical theory of heat, gives rules describing how heat flows, and the relationship between heat and other kinds of energy, as well as on Statistical mechanics, which is the discipline that explains the nature of temperature, entropy, and provides a fundamental and microscopic explanation of thermodynamics in terms of probability and laws of statistics. The course follows the textbook \u201cMolecular Thermodynamics\u201d by\u00a0D.A. McQuarrie\u00a0and\u00a0John Simon, and \u201cMolecular Driving Force\u201d by\u00a0K.A. Dill\u00a0and\u00a0S. Bromberg.The course begins with the concept of Microstates and Entropy, the equal a priori probabilities assumption, the direction of approaching equilibrium as a process that maximizes the total number of microstates. It then discusses the nature of Temperature and uses heat transfer as an example to illustrate the process that maximizes the number of microstates. It continues with the derivation of the Boltzmann distribution and the physical meaning of partition function, followed by simple and concise applications of Boltzmann distribution. It then covers the factorization approximation, Translational Partition Function and Partition function of the monatomic ideal gas, obtaining energy and pressure from the partition function. It follows with the vibrational and rotational partition functions, and the intuitive understanding of heat capacities of solid and diatomic molecules. The course continues with the equipartition theorem of energy, and the concept of negative temperature. It then covers the Statistical Entropy, Entropy for model systems and detailed examples, Gibbs Entropy Formula and applications. For the Thermodynamics part of the class, it begins with the Basic logic of Thermodynamics, spontaneous processes, and the direction of approaching equilibrium. It continuous with the first law of Thermodynamics, Work, and Heat, The second law of Thermodynamics, and thermodynamics definition of Entropy, The third law of Thermodynamics, the Temperature dependence of Entropy, the concept of Enthalpy and its application in Thermochemistry. Then it follows with the Helmholtz Free energy, Gibbs Free Energy, Maxwell Relation and Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The course then discusses the applications, focusing on Phase Equilibria, Chemical Potential, Gibbs-Duhem Equation, Solutions. It ends with the discussions of Chemical Equilibrium, Chemical Kinetics, Transition State Theory. The course also has peer-lead workshop sessions. In these sessions, students will work in teams and lead by workshop leaders to discuss concepts learned in lectures and solve problems that exemplify the concepts discussed in lecture material and explain their solutions to each other. Workshops help the students to engage with the material together with their peers. The class also contains 2-3 midterm exams and 10-11 homework problems, as well as a final exam.This course uses the Tues/Thurs 8:00 - 9:30 am Common Exam time.

Slaveholders justified the practice of slavery in America based in part on their own interpretation of ancient Roman and Greek models and ideologies of slavery. Both as a reaction to this pro-slavery use of ancient allusions and also because of the 19th century cultural value of Classical education and the authority of ancient examples, many American abolitionist thinkers, politicians, and activists also incorporated ancient examples and ideals into their own anti-slavery arguments. This course will explore the influence of the ancient Mediterranean world on the expression and evolution of abolitionist activities and political thought, with a particular focus on the rich local anti-slavery history of Rochester and Western New York. We will examine primary sources from the ancient world and the 18th and 19th centuries and consider the role of ideas about the ancient world as it relates to modern slavery and the movement to abolish it in the United States."

This emissary carried with him an illustrated narrative scroll from Goshirakawa\u2019s own secret collection. The shogun, however, dared not even glance at the contents and ordered its immediate return. Japan\u2019s celebrated tradition of graphic storytelling can in part trace its roots to a culture of illustrated narrative that began in the 8th century. This course introduces students to illustrated narrative scrolls and other forms of visual and performative culture from the late classical through the early modern period with reference to modern manifestations of Japan\u2019s ongoing visual culture. Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image. In considering how illustrated scrolls developed and matured as a Japanese art form, we will dare to look where Japan\u2019s first shogun did not, and in so doing, come to understand his refusal to do so\u2014and something of our own desire to view and be viewed.

In 2018 it was added to the name of the Ministry of the Interior, and now that ministry is often called the \u201cHeimatministerium.\u201d It is not a coincidence that the rising prominence of this term has been accompanied by increasingly open and mainstream attacks against immigrants, asylum seekers, trans and non-binary people, and other marginalized groups. The term, which can be loosely translated as \u201chomeland\u201d in English, invokes a nostalgic yearning for an idyllic harmonious past, but this past is an imaginary one. Throughout its history, Heimat has often been closely tied to discourses of the nation and national identity, and the process of creating this homeland is an exclusionary one that tries to establish clear boundaries between who belongs.

Coincidence or not, the war has catapulted Zelensky to the world stage and is inextricably part of how history will remember him. The entire biography of Vladimir Zelensky as an actor, politician, father, and husband can be recounted in an hour. It seems more interesting to us to understand how he rehabilitated the creative intelligentsia, proving that an actor and producer can be an outstanding leader of a country. Our task is to trace the formation of a special type of king-narrator, a king-storyteller, who gives the population of the country a plot of existence, a goal and meaning, while professionals deal with economics, defense, and diplomacy. We can trace this type already in the biography of Donald Trump, as Zelensky himself has repeatedly stated. But the signs of this type\u2014a writer, actor, showman, or scientist at the head of a country\u2014we have already seen many times, from the unsuccessful experience of Nero to the triumphant experience of Reagan. We will analyze the cases of the writer D'Annunzio, the journalist Mussolini, the novelist and painter Churchill, the playwright Havel, the poets Mao Zedong and Andropov.

    "description": "When modern Russian literature began to evolve in the mid-1600s, the printed or written text was immediately seen as a potential danger to the power of Church and State. In this course we will examine dangerous texts from the 17th century to the present to see what aspects of texts and their authors were seen as threats and how these threats were dealt with. We will also see the ways in which writers did indeed perceive themselves as a \u2018second government\u2019 and how this changed the way they wrote. The main problem with censorship is that sooner or later it has to be abolished, and then there is a great temptation to destroy the entire state power as a whole. This happened in Russia in 1905 and 1989. The danger of the texts of Russian writers is not that they destroy the state, but that the authorities begin to ban them and commit inevitable suicidal stupidities. Not every politically courageous text becomes dangerous. The authorities react only to what encroaches on the very foundations of slavery - the problems of prisons, patriarchal dependence, and the territorial unity of Russia, that is, everything that defines in the eyes of the authorities its \u201csovereignty.\u201d The goal of this course is to arrive at an understanding of the unique role played by literature in Russian history.

Lewis, \u201cof the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see.\u201d In recent years, Korean film and television has taken the world by storm in what is no small miracle of marketing, technology, and story-telling, but what does contemporary Korean film and television render visible that would otherwise be difficult to see? Onscreen interactions with the supernatural, divine, or horrific provide a unique medium for myth-making, identity formation, and world-building. In this course students will explore the ways in which religion in Korean film and television confront mortality and collective anxieties, and how the interaction between the religious and nonreligious serve as sites for the construction and interrogation of nation, race, gender, identity, modernity, cosmology, and moral discourse."

    "title": "There\u2019s No Place Like Home",
    "description": "In recent years, both on a local and on a national level, the word \u201cHeimat\" has played a prominent role in German politics. In 2018 it was added to the name of the Ministry of the Interior, and now that ministry is often called the \u201cHeimatministerium.\u201d It is not a coincidence that the rising prominence of this term has been accompanied by increasingly open and mainstream attacks against immigrants, asylum seekers, trans and non-binary people, and other marginalized groups. The term, which can be loosely translated as \u201chomeland\u201d in English, invokes a nostalgic yearning for an idyllic harmonious past, but this past is an imaginary one. Throughout its history, Heimat has often been closely tied to discourses of the nation and national identity, and the process of creating this homeland is an exclusionary one that tries to establish clear boundaries between who belongs. This course will explore representations of Heimat and attempts to redefine and resist the concept in German film, literature and politics from post-WWII to the present. Materials and discussions will be in English."

    "title": "Decolonial Theory & Praxis: Resistance & (Re)construction from the Global South",
    "description": "This course will provide an in-depth exploration of decolonial theory, focusing on the historical legacies of colonialism\u2014 coloniality\u2014, the establishment of settler colonialism, and the racial and gendering systems of exclusion they perpetuate. Students will critically examine the impact of colonialism/coloniality on contemporary power structures, knowledge systems, identity constructions, and spatial divisions. Particular attention will be given to practices of resistance and (re)construction emerging from decolonial Afro-feminist, indigenous, and queer/trans movements. Through an interdisciplinary lens encompassing theory, philosophy, history, and cultural production (literature and films), students will analyze theoretical productions of scholars from the Global South, such as Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Mar\u00eda Lugones, Ochy Curiel, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, among others. By the end of the course, students will develop a nuanced understanding of decolonial theory and its transformative potential in addressing contemporary issues of social justice, identity politics, and global solidarity. This course will be taught in English. Students enrolled for Spanish credit will do their writing and some of the readings in Spanish. Prerequisite for Spanish credit only: SPAN 200."

    "title": "The Zelensky Phenomenon: Portrait against the Background of a Nation",
    "description": "VZ are the initials of Vladimir Zelensky's name and the code letters emblazoned on Russian tanks and other armored vehicles of the forces that invaded Ukraine in February, 2022. Coincidence or not, the war has catapulted Zelensky to the world stage and is inextricably part of how history will remember him. The entire biography of Vladimir Zelensky as an actor, politician, father, and husband can be recounted in an hour. It seems more interesting to us to understand how he rehabilitated the creative intelligentsia, proving that an actor and producer can be an outstanding leader of a country. Our task is to trace the formation of a special type of king-narrator, a king-storyteller, who gives the population of the country a plot of existence, a goal and meaning, while professionals deal with economics, defense, and diplomacy. We can trace this type already in the biography of Donald Trump, as Zelensky himself has repeatedly stated. But the signs of this type\u2014a writer, actor, showman, or scientist at the head of a country\u2014we have already seen many times, from the unsuccessful experience of Nero to the triumphant experience of Reagan. We will analyze the cases of the writer D'Annunzio, the journalist Mussolini, the novelist and painter Churchill, the playwright Havel, the poets Mao Zedong and Andropov. And, of course, we will tell in detail how the comic actor and stand-up artist Vladimir Zelensky turned into one of the leaders of the free world. Taught in English."

    "description": "This course will examine representations of Algeria as a geographic, political, and symbolic space within French and Francophone Studies. We will pay particular attention to how French imperialist discourses from the early modern to the present have positioned Algeria paradoxically as both radically distinct from France and an integral part of the French nation and national identity. We will also examine films and texts that depict the Algerian War of Independence and its ongoing reverberations in French political and cultural life. Conducted in English."

    "description": "The focus of this course is to examine what makes a translation \"successful\" as a translation. By reading a series of recently translated works (some contemporary, some retranslations of modern classics), and by talking with translators, we will have the opportunity to discuss both specific and general issues that come up while translating a given text. Young translators will be exposed to a lot of practical advice throughout this class, helping to refine their approach to their own translations, and will expand their understanding of various practices and possibilities for the art and craft of literary translation."

While large language models (LLMs) do not yet have these capabilities, they exhibit \"sparks\" of AGI. In this course we review the concept of AGI and how we might assess a system to understand if it is an AGI. We will study the gaps in state-of-the-art systems and what would be needed for a system to be considered an AGI. We will also study AI ethics and safety, the socioeconomic implications of AGI, the likelihood of an intelligence explosion (i.e., the singularity), and existential risk due to AGI. Coursework includes readings, student presentations, and a project.Prerequisites: At least one course that covers neural networks, e.g., CSC 242, CSC 298/578, CSC 266/466, CSC 249/449, CSC 277/3477, or instructor permission.

WHile large language models (LLMs) do not yet have these capabilities, they exhibit \"sparks\" of AGI. In this course we review the concept of AGI and how we might assess a system to understand if it is an AGI. We will study the gaps in state-of-the-art systems and what would be needed for a system to be considered an AGI. We will also study AI ethics and safety, the socioeconomic implications of AGI, the likelihood of an intelligence explosion (i.e., the singularity), and existential risk due to AGI.

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; interaction techniques for AR/VR systems; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education & professional training. In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; interaction techniques for AR/VR systems; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education & professional training. In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

We find a strong grounding through upright dance focusing on the 5 positions of the spine through various standing and travelling sequences.\u00a0Second, we move on to release based techniques with a focus on using the stability we have found with Cunningham and applying in a more relaxed and somatic approach. Working on both floor work and standing work we have our emphasis on finding ease of movement through the use of breath and other sensations such as swinging.\u00a0Lastly we move away from codified dancing to work on improvisation, where we can draw from everything we have learned in a more creative way of working that is more about interpreting tasks than recreating taught phrases granting you more autonomy over your dancing."

We\u2019ll learn how to interpret articles about AI in the media with a critical eye and discuss what would be necessary for media to do a better job of writing about AI. But we\u2019ll also experiment with AI tools to explore what it means to write with AI. Throughout the semester, we\u2019ll dive deeper into what it is that we humans do when we write, from brainstorming all the way through final drafts, and we\u2019ll probe what happens when we add AI to the mix at each of those stages in a series of reflective assignments. These will build towards a final project in which students offer a research-based proposal for a specific way in which AI could be effectively and ethically used by writers."

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; interaction techniques for AR/VR systems; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education & professional training. In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

Because of the diversity and complexity of computer hardware, programmers increasingly depend on automation in compilers and other tools to deliver efficient and reliable software. This course combines fundamental principles and (hands-on) practical applications. Specific topics include data flow and dependence theories; static and dynamic program transformation including parallelization; memory and cache management; type checking and program verification; and performance analysis and modeling. The knowledge and practice will help students to become experts in software performance and correctness. Students taking the graduate level will have additional course requirements and a more difficult project.Recommended prerequisites: CSC 252, CSC 254"

    "title": "Econ Theory of Organizations",
    "description": "This course teaches how to approach and solve a wide range of organizational design problems, whether as manager at any level, entrepreneur, or consultant. In a world in which most sources of competitive advantage are fleeting, organizational effectiveness has emerged as a key source of long-run competitive advantage. Conversely, many corporate failures can be traced to poor internal organization. Problems covered range from individual job design to the structure of entire organizations and the boundaries of the firm (e.g., M&A decisions or vertical integration). The course discusses in detail the assignment of decision rights (including centralization vs. decentralization of decisions), performance measurement, and incentives and rewards. These are the three elements of \u201corganizational architecture,\u201d a central framework of the course. Throughout, the course stresses the importance of fit between a firm\u2019s internal organization and its strategy. The course adopts an analytical-economic perspective that is grounded in the field of organizational economics. It also addresses the managerial and behavioral dimensions of organizational problems, drawing on insights from psychology and sociology as appropriate.First year and sophomore students are not eligible for this course. Note: This is the only section of ECON214 being offered in Spring 2025.Prerequisite: ECON 207Overlapped: STR 203-2, ECON 214W-2, ECON 214-2** If the section is full, please request the course here on UR Student and then email ugbusiness@rochester.edu to be added to the waitlist.

    "title": "Economic Theory of Organizations",
    "description": "The course combines basic economic concepts with agency theory and the concept of specific knowledge to develop a framework for understanding how executive efforts to create organizations affect business outcomes. The building of that framework includes a discussion of executive talent. Topics considered include: the linkage between formulating corporate strategy and building organizations that facilitate its execution, the link between maintaining competitive relevance and organizational evolution, the importance of decentralization, the importance of performance-evaluation\u00a0as a tool for achieving decentralization, the challenges of implementing incentives and the links between organizational structure and ethical conduct. The goal is to enable students to better understand when poor corporate performance is traceable to a flawed organizational structure.First year and sophomore students are not eligible for this course.

    "title": "Public Economics",
    "description": "The course examines the role of the government in the economy, answering \"why\", \"when\", and \"how\" it should intervene. We begin with the \"why\", exploring normative approaches to resource allocation through welfare economics, distributive justice, and bargaining theory, establishing efficiency and equity as key government objectives. To address the \"when\", we analyze the benchmark case of competitive markets and the welfare theorems, followed by an exploration of various market failures (externalities, public goods, market power, asymmetric information). We then study the government's tools for intervention, both in markets (taxes and quotas) and beyond markets (regulations and institutions). Since these tools reshape incentives, the \"how\" focuses on understanding the responses of economic agents to government actions. Drawing insights from public finance, labor economics, and political economy, we distinguish between mechanical and behavioral changes and explore government failures. Finally, we integrate these elements to build a positivist framework for assessing the quality of public policies based on government normative objectives."

Earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis lay waste to buildings, towns and sometimes entire cities. Dormant volcanoes come to life in explosions of lava and large volumes of aerosols and greenhouse gases, with implications for global climate change. In this course, we learn how these geological hazards are a violent manifestation of plate tectonics, the movement of the relatively rigid plates forming Earth's outer shell. The first third of the class focuses on the causative mechanisms of earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, volcanic-eruption induced climate change. The second third outlines the consequent hazards and forecasting efforts, and feedbacks between these processes. The final third of the course examines mitigation programs, with numerous case studies"

This course will provide a comprehensive and quantitative treatment of the physics that underlie ocean circulation. The dynamical equations that govern circulation will be introduced early in the course, then applied and simplified to understand the force balances that explain the major circulation regimes of the ocean: surface wind-driven circulation, gyres and western boundary currents, and the deep thermohaline circulation. The course will then explore how these circulation regimes also shape the biology of the ocean, and interact with atmospheric circulation and the global climate system. The course will involve solving and manipulating differential equations, and a background understanding of these methods is required. However, no previous oceanography experience will be assumed."

    "description": "An introduction to moral philosophy as applied to current topics. Some questions to be explored: What sorts of socioeconomic principles are morally justifiable? Does the history of racial injustice in the U.S. create a moral demand for reparations, and if so, what is the best argument for this? What is the relation, if any, between morality and religion? Do animals have moral rights? How should we understand the meaning and value of human life and death? Can abortion sometimes be justified, and if so, how? Is it okay to destroy embryos for stem cell research? Is active euthanasia ever permissible? Is capital punishment justifiable in principle? In practice? Is torture morally permissible in the fight against terrorism? How far does our moral duty to aid distant strangers extend? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means? Are there objective facts about right or wrong, or is morality ultimately relative to cultures or times? Are there situations in which every available action is wrong? Can we be morally assessed even for some things that are largely a matter of luck?"

Students will apply these models to specific academic and social contexts of their choice. Some questions we might ask are: Can argument or evidence be understood absent context? What do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? For instance, is there common ground in how we argue about English literature and how biologists argue about the natural world? How do audience and purpose in disciplines such as psychology, physics and philosophy shape what counts as an argument in their respective fields? Does political argument resemble academic argument? What strategies will enable experts to communicate more effectively with public audiences in fields such as public health and the environmental humanities? Students will write frequent reflections, develop several short papers, and the semester will culminate in the construction of a final project of the student\u2019s own design (for example, a research paper, a website, a podcast\u2026) that can focus on any aspect of academic, professional, or political argumentation."

    "title": "British Literature II",
    "description": "This course introduces students to some of the most significant literature from the Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist literary periods. The literature of the nineteenth and twentieth century witnessed an era of monumental change: the American and French Revolution; rising democracy and the fight for the equal rights of women, workers, and slaves; colonial expansion and colonial rebellion; the beginnings of climate change and the first World War. In this course we will examine how literary figures from this period responded to this time of tumultuous change. How did writers use various literary forms, ranging from poetry, novels, and essays, to reflect on the world that was being transformed around them and to express their own point of view? How was literature for poets and novelists not just a space for private artistic expression, but also a way to articulate political dissent? In addressing these questions, we will focus on an array of novelists, poets, and essayists who will serve as touchstones for the key political, intellectual, and aesthetic problems of their times (e.g. William Blake, P. B. Shelley, John Ruskin, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, T.S. Eliot, Joseph Conrad, and Virginia Woolf, to name a few). Students will not only gain a greater appreciation for the artistic vision of individual authors, but they will also be able to situate these writers within a larger framework of ideas and historical currents.

Alongside this process of literary development, British America is gradually becoming unified around a new national identity\u2014yet, at the same time, constantly threatening to fracture under internal and external pressures. Our focus will be on the literary side of the story, but we\u2019ll remain mindful of its relationships to that larger history.

How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting.

In addition to primary texts, we will examine a number of important theories of tragedy (Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weil, Benjamin, Arendt). Our readings will be guided by such questions as: what might the story of this genre tell us about the longer history of representation? And how does tragedy illuminate basic problems such as the appeal of violence and vengeance, the role of religion in society, and the difficulty of finding an ethics that works for all people?"

The poems of these writers are marked by an intense, passionate style of intellectual play, by wildness of metaphor, density of thought, and dramatic force of language. Their poems range from the secular to the sacred, from witty and often bluntly sexual love poems to poems of divine praise and spiritual affliction. The metaphysicals have been a continual provocation to later poets, from Emily Dickinson and T. S. Eliot to Elizabeth Bishop and John Ashbery, and we\u2019ll be looking at some of these responses as well. Relevant cluster: Poems, Poetry, and Poetics (H1ENG012).

    "description": "What does it mean to be a writer in a world where AI systems like ChatGPT or Claude can produce text that is at least sometimes indistinguishable from text written by a human? In this course, we will explore a variety of AI tools with the goal of understanding how these tools might fit into the writing process and where the possible pitfalls lie. We\u2019ll learn how to interpret articles about AI in the media with a critical eye and discuss what would be necessary for media to do a better job of writing about AI. But we\u2019ll also experiment with AI tools to explore what it means to write with AI. Throughout the semester, we\u2019ll dive deeper into what it is that we humans do when we write, from brainstorming all the way through final drafts, and we\u2019ll probe what happens when we add AI to the mix at each of those stages in a series of reflective assignments. These will build towards a final project in which students offer a research-based proposal for a specific way in which AI could be effectively and ethically used by writers."

    "description": "The course will focus on literary treatments of the ancient theme of metamorphosis, myths and fictions that describe the transformation of human beings and gods into beasts, plants, elements, and objects, as well as the bringing to life of things that are inanimate, lifeless. \u00a0One fundamental text will be the book-length poem Metamorphoses by the Roman poet Ovid, a work that offers an encyclopedic re-telling of hundreds of ancient Greek myths of transformation\u2014playful, dramatic, erotic, psychologically complex, often grotesque and violent. \u00a0Ovid\u2019s poem evolves a vision of change as a process central to all being, something at once natural and supernatural, human and inhuman, by turns liberating and entrapping, creative and destructive. \u00a0Among the later texts that take up and further explore the theme of metamorphosis, we\u2019ll look at passages from Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy (especially his Inferno), the medieval Irish poem Sweeney Astray, Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, and Franz Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis. \u00a0If there\u2019s time, we\u2019ll also be looking at how the idea of metamorphosis creeps into different traditions of fairy tales, and into certain central texts of modern and contemporary poetry. \u00a0Relevant cluster: Poems, Poetry, and Poetics (H1ENG012). \u00a0Can count for either the pre- or post-1800 requirement for English majors."

    "title": "Keats, Hopkins, and Yeats",
    "description": "The life of John Keats is the stuff of romantic legend. The son of a London innkeeper and initially trained as a doctor, Keats would go on to write some of the most memorable poems of the English language before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25 in Italy, far from the love of his life Fanny Brawne. In this course we will read a variety of Keats\u2019s poems and letters, paying attention to how he overcame the prejudices against his social class and developed the stylistic traits for which he is now famous\u2014lush imagery, sensuous verbal music, intense emotion, and imaginative vision. Despite his brief life, Keats\u2019s poems have exerted a lasting influence. This course traces Keats\u2019s influence on two major poets of the Victorian and Modernist eras\u2014Gerard Manley Hopkins and William Butler Yeats. Hopkins, a Jesuit priest who wrote moving poems about nature in an era of industrialism and struggled with his religious faith and homoerotic desires, would seem to have little in common with the Irish poet Yeats, who explored everything from Gaelic myths and revolutionary politics to the occult. This course explores how, despite their many differences, both Hopkins and Yeats were inspired by the work of Keats, who provided a model for their literary experiments and for the poet as visionary. No prerequisites or prior knowledge of poetry required for this class. Fulfills the post-1800 requirement. No prerequisites. Counts towards the following clusters: Great Books, Great Authors (H1ENG010) and Poems, Poetry, and Poetics (H1ENG012)."

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women\u2019s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history. \u00a0We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. Looking at works originating in a wide range of locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction."

We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and the state of film conservation and preservation worldwide. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact.

    "description": "Apart from his infamous cameos, Alfred Hitchcock was a filmmaker who wanted his presence\u2014seen or unseen\u2014felt by his audience. When you watch a Hitchcock film, you are meant to be acutely aware that it is Hitchcock\u2019s film. This course examines how exactly that works. More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Auteurism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheroes,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

The way in which they publicly represent their group, movement, or organization can make the difference between growing their ranks and successfully struggling against that power or failing to gain a foothold and remaining marginal or unknown. In this course we will examine some of the history of how movements and struggles have articulated their identity, mission, and goals to the world using critical, literary, and rhetorical theory to better understand those specific representational choices as forms of rhetorical praxis. We will consider many genres of resistance rhetoric, from manifestos, declarations, and slogans to pamphlets and essays, all of which also had specific authorial conditions and reception contexts. While written texts will form the majority of the first half of our course, we will venture into examining images, both still and moving, to understand how the mass reproducibility of graphics and images affected how movements represented themselves over the decades.

What do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? For instance, is there common ground in how we argue about English literature and how biologists argue about the natural world? How do audience and purpose in disciplines such as psychology, physics and philosophy shape what counts as an argument in their respective fields? Does political argument resemble academic argument? What strategies will enable experts to communicate more effectively with public audiences in fields such as public health and the environmental humanities? Students will write frequent reflections, develop several short papers, and the semester will culminate in the construction of a final project of the student\u2019s own design (for example, a research paper, a website, a podcast\u2026) that can focus on any aspect of academic, professional, or political argumentation."

This emissary carried with him an illustrated narrative scroll from Goshirakawa\u2019s own secret collection. The shogun, however, dared not even glance at the contents and ordered its immediate return. Japan\u2019s celebrated tradition of graphic storytelling can in part trace its roots to a culture of illustrated narrative that began in the 8th century. This course introduces students to illustrated narrative scrolls and other forms of visual and performative culture from the late classical through the early modern period with reference to modern manifestations of Japan\u2019s ongoing visual culture. Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image. In considering how illustrated scrolls developed and matured as a Japanese art form, we will dare to look where Japan\u2019s first shogun did not, and in so doing, come to understand his refusal to do so\u2014and something of our own desire to view and be viewed.

Through a close textual analysis of the second half of 'Purgatorio' and the entirety of 'Paradiso,' students learn how to approach Dante's poetry as a vehicle for thought, an instrument of self-discovery, and a way to understand and affect the historical reality. They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dante's concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology. A visual component, including illustrations of the 'Comedy' and multiple artworks pertinent to the narrative, complements the course.

The second considers the revival of tragedy in early modern England both as a prestigious neoclassical form and as a vehicle for domestic themes traditionally associated with comedy (Marlowe, Shakespeare, Dryden). The third takes up the disappearance--or transformation--of tragedy in more recent times (Beckett, Lorca). In addition to primary texts, we will examine a number of important theories of tragedy (Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weil, Benjamin, Arendt). Our readings will be guided by such questions as: what might the story of this genre tell us about the longer history of representation? And how does tragedy illuminate basic problems such as the appeal of violence and vengeance, the role of religion in society, and the difficulty of finding an ethics that works for all people?"

    "title": "Keats, Hopkins, and Yeats",
    "description": "The life of John Keats is the stuff of romantic legend. The son of a London innkeeper and initially trained as a doctor, Keats would go on to write some of the most memorable poems of the English language before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25 in Italy, far from the love of his life Fanny Brawne. In this course we will read a variety of Keats\u2019s poems and letters, paying attention to how he overcame the prejudices against his social class and developed the stylistic traits for which he is now famous\u2014lush imagery, sensuous verbal music, intense emotion, and imaginative vision. Despite his brief life, Keats\u2019s poems have exerted a lasting influence. This course traces Keats\u2019s influence on two major poets of the Victorian and Modernist eras\u2014Gerard Manley Hopkins and William Butler Yeats. Hopkins, a Jesuit priest who wrote moving poems about nature in an era of industrialism and struggled with his religious faith and homoerotic desires, would seem to have little in common with the Irish poet Yeats, who explored everything from Gaelic myths and revolutionary politics to the occult. This course explores how, despite their many differences, both Hopkins and Yeats were inspired by the work of Keats, who provided a model for their literary experiments and for the poet as visionary. No prerequisites or prior knowledge of poetry required for this class. Fulfills the post-1800 requirement. No prerequisites. Counts towards the following clusters: Great Books, Great Authors (H1ENG010) and Poems, Poetry, and Poetics (H1ENG012)."

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women\u2019s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history. \u00a0We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. Looking at works originating in a wide range of locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction."

We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and the state of film conservation and preservation worldwide. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact.

    "title": "Drama and Cultural Crisis",
    "description": "As a form that hovers between page and stage, dramatic literature disrupts traditional categories of authorship and reception, mind and body, private and public. As a text that is (usually) intended to be performed, drama is innately political. It also has a unique relationship to time: a play changes with every new performance, performer, and production\u2014and yet it arguably retains some essential quality over the days and years and centuries. This course takes a double focus, joining plays from Britain's Restoration Period\u2014just following a period of civil war\u2014with contemporary works that reflect current social and political upheavals (including MeToo, Black Lives Matter, and late capitalism). We will also look at two of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies\u2014Lear and Hamlet--and trace how they were adapted both by 17th- and 18th-century dramatists, as well as by contemporary American and British writers. Authors include Shakespeare, Thomas Shadwell, Nahum Tate, Aphra Behn, and George Lillo, as well as Liz Duffy Adams, Annie Baker, Lynn Nottage, and Jack Thorne. Theorists will include Aristotle, Dryden, Brecht, Artaud, and others."

    "title": "The Uncanny Cinema",
    "description": "The uncanny is an experience or quality that by definition remains difficult to grasp; something that is mysterious and enigmatic, yet also seems oddly familiar. \u00a0It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explored since nearly the beginning of cinema. Some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old. This seminar will also explore the nature of film's relation to animation, the \"bringing to life\" through moving images. It will delve into cinema's relation to other traditions of life-like illusions (from automatons to panoramas), its exploration of the thresholds between animate and inanimate in horror films, fairy tales and comedies, and all of these in relation to what is technically referred to as film animation, both animated films which bring things to life (Brothers Quay, Svankmajer, Cohl) as well as abstract animation which aspires to trace patterns of animation (Fischinger, Ruttmann, Breer)."

    "title": "Nobel Prize Literature",
    "description": "This course will provide an opportunity to sample an exciting body of contemporary literature, some written by authors already widely acclaimed when they received the Nobel Prize and some by writers suddenly catapulted into fame and international recognition. A central focus of the course will be the literature itself, but we will also look at the kinds of controversies that the prize has always generated \u2013 including the 2018 sex scandal that led to the prize\u2019s temporary suspension. One lens for the course, then, will be a study of the logic of cultural prize-giving, especially as it operates in the global marketplace. In the US, where less then 5% of literary writing published each year is literature in translation, Nobel prize-winning titles are often the only contemporary fiction or poetry Americans read in translation. This raises the question of translation and the role of the Nobel Prize in creating and promoting a powerful, if not uncontested, idea of \u201cinternational\u201d literature. Finally, with only 16 of the 114 prizes awarded since 1901 going to women, we will consider the role of gender in the prize\u2019s history."

We will use a blend of class discussions, case studies and lectures to explore the theory and practice of responsible business. Questions to be discussed include the following. What role can business play in meeting societal needs in improving health and education, protecting the environment or eradicating poverty? Do firms have a responsibility to help meet these needs? What are the limits of what can and should be done through business rather than through NGOs, development agencies or international institutions? How can we identify and measure the impact of business? We will look at these questions in the context of topics such as environmental sustainability, poverty and inequality, health promotion, lobbying, impact investing, advertising, fake news, nudging, machine learning and big data, and markets for organs.Offered every other year.** If the section is full, please request the course here on UR Student and then email ugbusiness@rochester.edu to be added to the waitlist.

Various facets of stocks and bonds are also introduced, and a brief overview of the stock market is presented. Cash flow concepts are then incorporated into a development of how investment opportunities are analyzed, which includes a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses associated with different analytical methods. The topics of capital market efficiency and portfolio theory are then discussed and tied in to the concept of what investors have sacrificed in order to invest in a firm. This, in turn, is tied in to which investments are worthwhile to a firm's owners.

The first half of this course will focus on how to calculate and forecast net cash flows from financial statements to be used in a DCF as well as in depth understanding and proper determination of the components of the risk-adjusted cost of capital used to discount future net cash flows. The second half of the course will apply these valuation concepts to mergers and acquisitions. We will study the use of valuation multiples (e.g. P/E ratios) and how multiples relate to DCF theory.

    "description": "In recent years, both on a local and on a national level, the word \u201cHeimat\" has played a prominent role in German politics. In 2018 it was added to the name of the Ministry of the Interior, and now that ministry is often called the \u201cHeimatministerium.\u201d It is not a coincidence that the rising prominence of this term has been accompanied by increasingly open and mainstream attacks against immigrants, asylum seekers, trans and non-binary people, and other marginalized groups. The term, which can be loosely translated as \u201chomeland\u201d in English, invokes a nostalgic yearning for an idyllic harmonious past, but this past is an imaginary one. Throughout its history, Heimat has often been closely tied to discourses of the nation and national identity, and the process of creating this homeland is an exclusionary one that tries to establish clear boundaries between who belongs. This course will explore representations of Heimat and attempts to redefine and resist the concept in German film, literature and politics from post-WWII to the present.

When you watch a Hitchcock film, you are meant to be acutely aware that it is Hitchcock\u2019s film. This course examines how exactly that works. More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Auteurism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheroes,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

    "description": "In recent years, both on a local and on a national level, the word \u201cHeimat\" has played a prominent role in German politics. In 2018 it was added to the name of the Ministry of the Interior, and now that ministry is often called the \u201cHeimatministerium.\u201d It is not a coincidence that the rising prominence of this term has been accompanied by increasingly open and mainstream attacks against immigrants, asylum seekers, trans and non-binary people, and other marginalized groups. The term, which can be loosely translated as \u201chomeland\u201d in English, invokes a nostalgic yearning for an idyllic harmonious past, but this past is an imaginary one. Throughout its history, Heimat has often been closely tied to discourses of the nation and national identity, and the process of creating this homeland is an exclusionary one that tries to establish clear boundaries between who belongs. This course will explore representations of Heimat and attempts to redefine and resist the concept in German film, literature and politics from post-WWII to the present. Materials and discussions will be in English."

    "description": "This course will explore the gradual evolution of Freud\u2019s thought toward the place and role of religion in society in conversation with other psychoanalytic thinkers, like C. G. Jung and Julia Kristeva. In Freud\u2019s early works, he portrayed religion as a \u201ccollective neurosis of mankind\u201d arguing that religious beliefs serve the fulfill the immature psychological and emotional needs of the child within the adult self. Therefore, he firmly advocated for replacing these illusions with a more scientific and materialistic attitude that would be based on science and impassioned observation. However, signaling a dramatic change in Freud\u2019s attitude, his later works present religion as critical for the wellbeing of society and even vital for its survival. In the course we will trace important works and ideas that helped to shape Freud\u2019s intellectual development illuminating his nuanced understanding of religion."

    "description": "How do we intentionally occupy space? What are the implications of demanding recognition in a world designed for able-bodied individuals? Where does society draw the line at accessibility for all? How do we demarcate what defines accessibility? Why the hell does gender even factor into the equation? (Dis)abled people are often consciously denied the ability to design a world filled with spaces attainable for everyone in some form. In a social climate increasingly bereft of basic needs met, the act of influencing how we consider the needs of others can be viewed as radically political. This course centers on the experiences of multiply marginalized (dis)abled people by engaging students in ideas like Crip Theory, Transnational Feminism, Queer Studies, and Trans Studies. From an intersectional and interdisciplinary multimedia perspective, students will learn to critically examine the history of Western medicine, law, politics, and culture. This class offers a space in which we approach disabilities like depression, anxiety, autism, Deaf culture, chronic illnesses, body size, sexual orientation, and gender identity as complex sites of social expectations, personal experiences, state interventions, knowledge production, and exuberant life."

Our four main readings hail from three pivotal moments in 20th century German history: the era of political unrest preceding and following World War I; the Nazi era and its aftermath, and during the social movements and political upheavals of the 60\u2019s in both East and West Germany.

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women\u2019s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history. We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. Looking at works originating in a wide range of locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction."

    "description": "Rochester\u2019s history began long before the first permanent settlement in 1812 and was marked by a long and violent conflict between native peoples, the French and the British. \u00a0 Wheat harvested in the Genesee Valley was ground into flour using the power of the Genesee River as it dropped 260 feet to Lake Ontario. \u00a0 Transporting flour and other goods to New York City and other markets was difficult until the Erie Canal was completed in 1825. \u00a0The canal enabled an enormous migration of settlers moving west, and many chose to stay in Rochester. \u00a0The village became a city in 1834 with a vibrant and expanding mix of cultures that joined together to make Rochester a vibrant commercial and manufacturing center. \u00a0The Western Union Telegraph Company traces its roots to Rochester in 1851 and in 1853 eight local New York railroads merged to form the New York Central, whose tracks ran parallel to the Erie Canal. \u00a0 In 1881 a local bank clerk, George Eastman, quit his job to devote his full attention to the business of photography and founded the Eastman Kodak Company. \u00a0The Haloid Photographic Company was founded in Rochester in 1906 and entered into an agreement with inventor Chester Carlson in 1946 that resulted in the introduction of the Xerox 914 plain paper copy machine in 1959 was adopted around the world. \u00a0 Nevertheless, Rochester\u2019s most famous residents are likely Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, who were instrumental in the struggle to expand civil rights to all Americans. \u00a0The local community, however, struggled to welcome the large numbers of African Americans who moved to Rochester after World War II. \u00a0Housing discrimination, white flight to the suburbs, and riots marked the 1960s, and the city today has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country. \u00a0Nevertheless, the city has vibrant cultural and educational institutions that continue to attract talented newcomers. \u00a0In short, the history of Rochester has a bit of everything and students in the course are encouraged to study the entire experience of the community, including topics that may be new and frankly uncomfortable."

While questions of health, disease, and death certainly preoccupied premodern thinkers, this course follows recent trends in feminist and queer historical scholarship by privileging questions of gender and sexuality. As we read works on the body by modern historians and premodern thinkers alike, we\u2019ll encounter medieval sex workers, lesbian nuns, a self-proclaimed \u201chermaphrodite\u201d accused of sorcery, a fifteenth-century mystic whose unconventional writings described her sensual longing for Jesus Christ and, of course, plenty of so-called \u201csodomites.\u201d As we transition from the medieval to the early modern period, we\u2019ll consider the destructive and mutually transformative encounter between two civilizations\u2014European and American\u2014with distinct views on bodies, gender, and desire. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll explore how sex became linked with sin, how virginity came to signify virtue and, more broadly, how certain gendered behaviors and embodiments became associated with transgression and others with normalcy (or even, in some cases, holiness). Most crucially, we\u2019ll ask how knowledge about the body (\u201ccarnal knowledge,\u201d if you\u2019ll excuse the pun) has been produced, by whom, and to what ends, in concrete moments throughout European history."

Why do we celebrate some urban wildlife while ignoring, reviling, and even exterminating others? This introduction to the interdisciplinary field of animal studies addresses these and other questions through recent scholarship on multispecies cities. The first part of the course surveys urban human-animal ecology from domestication to enclosure with an emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. In the second part, we ponder contemporary studies of interspecies contact, collision, and cohabitation, from macaques in Delhi and mosquitos in Dar es Salaam to capybaras in Buenos Aires and parakeets in London. Students will gain an understanding of the historical forces that have shaped everyday encounters with nonhuman animals, particularly as they concern matters of violence, intimacy, and justice.

Readings will address the question of whether the persecution of \u201cdeviants\u201d began only in the twelfth century as part of the process of centralizing power in church and state.

    "description": "According to a story recorded in A Collection of Notable Tales Old and New, in the wake of a civil war that saw to the formation of the Kamakura shogunate, the Cloistered Sovereign Goshirakawa sent an emissary to the Shogun Minamoto Yoritomo. This emissary carried with him an illustrated narrative scroll from Goshirakawa\u2019s own secret collection. The shogun, however, dared not even glance at the contents and ordered its immediate return. Japan\u2019s celebrated tradition of graphic storytelling can in part trace its roots to a culture of illustrated narrative that began in the 8th century. This course introduces students to illustrated narrative scrolls and other forms of visual and performative culture from the late classical through the early modern period with reference to modern manifestations of Japan\u2019s ongoing visual culture. Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image. In considering how illustrated scrolls developed and matured as a Japanese art form, we will dare to look where Japan\u2019s first shogun did not, and in so doing, come to understand his refusal to do so\u2014and something of our own desire to view and be viewed.

After a preliminary look at the idea of \"exploration,\" what it means, and what distinguishes it from mere travel and/or adventure, we will focus each week on a discreet episode of scientific exploration, beginning with the epochal Pacific voyages of Captain James Cook and concluding with the Apollo missions to the moon. Other notable cases will include the South American travels of Alexander von Humboldt, the transcontinental journey of Lewis and Clark, Robert Scott's fateful journey to the South Pole, and early scientific exploration and mountaineering in the Himalaya. Our emphasis throughout will be on the complex relation between exploration and science, and on the ways in which exploration has shaped for good and ill our modern, globally interconnected world."

    "description": "North Africa and the Middle East is in a mess: Instead of democracy, the Arab Spring delivered a military dictatorship to Egypt; Iraq and Syria are melting into warring tribal enclaves; Saudi Arabia is waging a savage war in Yemen; and the Palestinians remain an unprotected stateless people. There is a crisis, and this course introduces students to the predicament, arguing that since the first Industrial Revolution in England, the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East have refashioned their destinies in partnership with the West. Students will examine how the following encounters helped make the region as we know it: the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1838, transition from Ottoman to West European colonialism, discovery of huge and easily extractable oil reserves, creation of the state of Israel, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and the US Invasion of Iraq in 2003. The class will also explore how the above patterns of engagement shaped the histories of the region's working classes, women, and the peasantry."

England prior to the Norman Conquest i(1066 c.e.) produced King Alfred, Beowulf and stunning poetry and prose, written at a time when Engla-lond fought for its cultural and political status in the British Isles. We\u2019ll explore the sublime, mystical, medical, and earthy writings of England: Wonders of the East, comets, portents, medicinal charms, riddles, the Paternoster and the Devil, maps, visions, wolves, women, runes, cross-dressing saints. We\u2019ll translate some texts in Old English and read others in translation, and as your l\u00e6restre (teaching servant) I\u2019ll help you learn Old English language and vocabulary, and explore the diversity of a people who\u2019ve been reduced to stereotype. Old English stood with Old Irish as being one of the earliest producers in the western Middle Ages of a people\u2019s native language on manuscript. England survived invasions by the Danes and the Normans (1066) which never completely replaced its language with Danish or French, merely enriched it."

    "title": "Ancient Slavery and Modern Abolition",
    "description": "Political and moral ideals from the ancient Mediterranean World played an important role in shaping the character of political and social institutions in the colonial and post-colonial United States. Slaveholders justified the practice of slavery in America based in part on their own interpretation of ancient Roman and Greek models and ideologies of slavery. Both as a reaction to this pro-slavery use of ancient allusions and also because of the 19th century cultural value of Classical education and the authority of ancient examples, many American abolitionist thinkers, politicians, and activists also incorporated ancient examples and ideals into their own anti-slavery arguments. This course will explore the influence of the ancient Mediterranean world on the expression and evolution of abolitionist activities and political thought, with a particular focus on the rich local anti-slavery history of Rochester and Western New York. We will examine primary sources from the ancient world and the 18th and 19th centuries and consider the role of ideas about the ancient world as it relates to modern slavery and the movement to abolish it in the United States."

Lewis, \u201cof the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see.\u201d In recent years, Korean film and television has taken the world by storm in what is no small miracle of marketing, technology, and story-telling, but what does contemporary Korean film and television render visible that would otherwise be difficult to see? Onscreen interactions with the supernatural, divine, or horrific provide a unique medium for myth-making, identity formation, and world-building. In this course students will explore the ways in which religion in Korean film and television confront mortality and collective anxieties, and how the interaction between the religious and nonreligious serve as sites for the construction and interrogation of nation, race, gender, identity, modernity, cosmology, and moral discourse."

    "title": "Catholicism and the Abuse Crisis",
    "description": "This course will examine the history of the Catholic sexual abuse crisis, which has garnered global attention in recent years. Although there had been nationally-reported cases of clerical sexual abuse for decades prior, perhaps most significantly the Boston Globe\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d series in 2002, a 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury investigation report marked a watershed moment in the study of this subject, by framing abuse as endemic to modern Catholicism. In their own words, \u201cit happened everywhere.\u201d In subsequent years, questions of who or what is to blame, and what penitent reconciliation might look like have become topics of intense debate. This course will study the history of abuse\u2014and institutional responses\u2014throughout global Catholicism, with an emphasis on North America. But it will also attend to abuse revelations as grounding contemporary debates about Catholic theology, ecclesiastical reform, and the nature of Church/State relations."

We will think about the \"encounter\" with war in reading. With a selection of texts drawn heavily from the World Wars of the twentieth century, we will investigate questions of how war is represented in different media. We will learn how to translate our reading into our own writing. This course is designed to introduce students to the practice of critical reading and textual analysis, practices that are the cornerstone of the humanistic / social science disciplines.

Focusing especially on the modern Central Europe (territories of former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Austro-Hungarian Empire) class will deal with fundamental concepts of a nation and nationalism. Using different approaches and theories (modernism, ethno-symbolism, ethnic and civic nationalism), it aims at applying them to both historical and contemporary reality. Beginning with pre-modern forms of national identity (noble nation?), the course will focus on the processes of formation modern nations in Central Europe and their consequences for the history of the region in 20th century. The class could have a mixed-form of a seminar and lecture, with students presentations on selected topic and readings, and discussions on theoretical and historical issues."

Instead of trying to discover and test grand \"covering laws\" that have universal validity and tremendous scope (think Newton's gravity or Einstein's relativity), the social sciences are in the process of switching to more narrow and middle-range theories and explanations, often referred to as causal mechanisms. Mechanisms play a crucial role in this new conception of theory in the social sciences. In this course we will examine one particular mechanism each week and see how it has been applied in international political economy and/or security studies. Students will be introduced to formal reasoning in an informal manner. We will explore several substantive themes, such as the \"democratic peace,\" ethnic conflict and international trade to illustrate the mechanisms and cumulative potential of this research approach."

Through literature, they expressed their views on social and political issues in a country still rooted in a patriarchal society, where men held exclusive control over politics and social spheres, leaving women with limited opportunities to voice their opinions. Despite these challenges, many women persevered in writing on a wide range of subjects, gaining praise both in Italy and\u00a0internationally.\u00a0\u00a0In this course, we will examine works by influential women writers\u00a0from 19th\u00a0and 20th-century Italy.\u00a0We will\u00a0analyze their\u00a0texts within\u00a0the socio-cultural contexts in which they lived. Themes will\u00a0include gender equality, social justice, family relationships,\u00a0and\u00a0existential questions.\u00a0\u00a0We will\u00a0read works\u00a0by\u00a0Grazia Deledda, the first Italian woman to win the Nobel Prize\u00a0(1926), Dacia\u00a0Maraini, whose plays, novels, and theater pieces continue to challenge traditional female stereotypes,\u00a0and\u00a0Lalla Romano, who delves into themes\u00a0of\u00a0memory and\u00a0identity.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a04-credit course is primarily taught in Italian, with readings available in English.\u00a0\u00a0Prerequisites: Ital 101, 102, 151, 200 or permission from the instructor."

Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact. Weekly film assignments. Class meets on River Campus and at George Eastman Museum (900 East Ave, no admission fee; STUDENTS PROVIDE THEIR OWN TRANSPORTATION FOR CLASSES OFF CAMPUS).

    "description": "According to a story recorded in A Collection of Notable Tales Old and New, in the wake of a civil war that saw to the formation of the Kamakura shogunate, the Cloistered Sovereign Goshirakawa sent an emissary to the Shogun Minamoto Yoritomo. This emissary carried with him an illustrated narrative scroll from Goshirakawa\u2019s own secret collection. The shogun, however, dared not even glance at the contents and ordered its immediate return. Japan\u2019s celebrated tradition of graphic storytelling can in part trace its roots to a culture of illustrated narrative that began in the 8th century. This course introduces students to illustrated narrative scrolls and other forms of visual and performative culture from the late classical through the early modern period with reference to modern manifestations of Japan\u2019s ongoing visual culture. Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image. In considering how illustrated scrolls developed and matured as a Japanese art form, we will dare to look where Japan\u2019s first shogun did not, and in so doing, come to understand his refusal to do so\u2014and something of our own desire to view and be viewed.

One of the oldest languages in the world, for several centuries Hebrew was used only as a literary tool until it was revived as a national Jewish language starting in the late 19th century. Today, Hebrew is the official language of Israel and is studied and spoken by Jews and non-Jews all around the world. Used in everyday life, songs, films, and on the Internet, Hebrew has never been so young!This course is the direct continuation of HBRW 101 that is taught in the Fall. Emphasis is on further developing reading, writing, comprehension, and speaking skills, with a focus on cultural orientation and the practical use of Hebrew in meaningful everyday situations. During the semester, students will expand the basic language skills acquired in HBRW 101, enhance their understanding of Hebrew grammar constructions (in particular, verbs in the present and past tense, use of direct object and prepositional verbs, common syntactical constructions), and increase their vocabulary. The course will cover the textbook Hebrew from Scratch vol. 1 from Lesson 3 through Lesson 17, and will be supplemented by additional written, audio, and video materials in Hebrew."

G. Jung and Julia Kristeva. In Freud\u2019s early works, he portrayed religion as a \u201ccollective neurosis of mankind\u201d arguing that religious beliefs serve the fulfill the immature psychological and emotional needs of the child within the adult self. Therefore, he firmly advocated for replacing these illusions with a more scientific and materialistic attitude that would be based on science and impassioned observation. However, signaling a dramatic change in Freud\u2019s attitude, his later works present religion as critical for the wellbeing of society and even vital for its survival. In the course we will trace important works and ideas that helped to shape Freud\u2019s intellectual development illuminating his nuanced understanding of religion."

We study the origins of anti-semitism, the interconnections between religious conflict and political violence, the power of the state to oppress religious groups, etc. Close careful analysis of texts and events from this particular historical-cultural context will provide us with the starting point to address fundamental questions about the nature of religious conflict, religious polemic, and religious oppression in general."

At the same time, Jewish textual and material sources reveal a world teeming with angels, demons, exorcism rituals, amulets and spells that go against the grain of normative religion. In this course, we will examine the place of magic in Judaism from the Bible, Talmudic sources, Babylonian incantation bowls, to medieval and early modern books of secrets and magic. Throughout the course, we will consider the relationship between Jewish and non-Jewish forms of magic, attitudes to the natural and supernatural worlds, as well as the use of plants, animals, and other substances in magical procedures. Questions that will frame our discourse: What is the relationship between magic and normative religion? What purpose does magic serve in Jewish life and lived religion? Who are the Jewish magicians? Does gender play a role in Jewish magic?"

In addition to the lecture students will need to register for a peer-led workshop."

    "description": "This course is a comprehensive review of the grammar of Modern Standard English. The course will be of interest to those who wish to sharpen their language skills, or to know more about the workings of the English language whether for practical, cognitive or creative ends. Drawing on work in mostly pre-theoretical, descriptive linguistics this course reveals the mechanics of Standard English structure, with occasional detours into the finesse of usage across registers (dialect to slang). Students will learn to develop the ability to see patterns in grammar, as well as its structural possibilities and limits. Assignments will regularly involve reflection on form, usage and speaker judgments. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of an English variety available to them. Throughout, students will be working with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammatical structures or yield ungrammaticality. Background in linguistics or grammar not needed."

The former refers to the existence of categories (today known as\u00a0phases) that are impenetrable for syntactic operations. The latter concerns competition among potential targets of operations, requiring that the closest suitable candidate is selected for the operation.The seminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of theoretical proposals addressing both types of locality, highlighting key empirical findings that have reshaped these theories over time. Through an exploration of foundational and recent literature, students will be equipped to conduct original research on the topic.Key questions we will explore in the seminar:Are both CPs and vPs phases?If so, how can we explain the relative transparency of vP?If not, how do we account for successive cyclic movement through vP?Do all operations\u2014A-movement, A-bar movement, \u03c6-agreement, case assignment, etc.\u2014observe the same locality domains?How do cross-clausal relations, such as hyperraising, align with the CP phase hypothesis?Is A-movement genuinely more local than A-bar movement?What is the locality of \u03c6-agreement?What is the locality of case assignment?How can we reconcile Relativized Minimality with inversion constructions, whose existence seems to directly contradict it?How do we reconcile Relativized Minimality with defective intervention, such as that caused by dative subjects in Icelandic?Through addressing these questions, the seminar will provide a structured path for students to critically engage with the intricate dynamics of syntactic locality."

    "title": "Translation: Interpreting & Adapting",
    "description": "This course takes up translation process as an object of study. How do translators work? What opportunities and constraints are present for freelance, specialist, or professional translators? To what extent do translators not only transmit but actively create knowledge and build community via their work of interpreting and adapting? We\u2019ll explore a range of potentially high-stakes cases involving textual, audiovisual, and multimodal renditions of a source text. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subbing a TED Talk or performance; dubbing in anime or games; interpreting for business, medical, or other purposes. Along with course readings and short experimental translations, students will work with our paraprofessional consultants and community partners in SW Rochester to craft final projects that provide a meaningful extension of course learning to real-world issues (Counts toward the Citation in Community-Engaged Scholarship; see Authentically Urban, Virtually Global: Southwest Rochester)."

By reading a series of recently translated works (some contemporary, some retranslations of modern classics), and by talking with translators, we will have the opportunity to discuss both specific and general issues that come up while translating a given text. Young translators will be exposed to a lot of practical advice throughout this class, helping to refine their approach to their own translations, and will expand their understanding of various practices and possibilities for the art and craft of literary translation."

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; interaction techniques for AR/VR systems; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education & professional training. In Spring 2025, the following three modules will be offered:1) Fundamentals of optics for AR/VR (Daniel Nikolov and Jannick Rolland). Optics is central to near-eye displays and sensing. In this module, students will learn basic concepts and terminology of optics for AR/VR, as well as key visual requirements. Students will then learn about different optical architectures based on free-space or waveguide optics. Emerging technologies enabling compact architectures such as freeform optics and meta optics will be discussed. Students will be exposed to demonstrations of hands-on design in optical design software.2) Interaction techniques for AR/VR systems (Yukang Yan). This module introduces the design and implementation of interaction techniques that can be applied in AR/VR systems, focusing on fundamental tasks such as target selection, navigation, object manipulation, and sensory input. Through the introduction of conceptual insights andhands-on practice, we aim to teach students how to create intuitive, effective interaction methods across different tasks and scenarios. Projects will encourage students to design and build their own interaction techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles and the technical skills necessary to bring interactive concepts to life.3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module involves a series of seminars (titled Voices of XR) and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry. This component of the course is offered in partnership with Studio X.Prerequisites: ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534 or equivalent experience.

Do animals have moral rights? How should we understand the meaning and value of human life and death? Can abortion sometimes be justified, and if so, how? Is it okay to destroy embryos for stem cell research? Is active euthanasia ever permissible? Is capital punishment justifiable in principle? In practice? Is torture morally permissible in the fight against terrorism? How far does our moral duty to aid distant strangers extend? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means? Are there objective facts about right or wrong, or is morality ultimately relative to cultures or times? Are there situations in which every available action is wrong? Can we be morally assessed even for some things that are largely a matter of luck?"

What do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? For instance, is there common ground in how we argue about English literature and how biologists argue about the natural world? How do audience and purpose in disciplines such as psychology, physics and philosophy shape what counts as an argument in their respective fields? Does political argument resemble academic argument? What strategies will enable experts to communicate more effectively with public audiences in fields such as public health and the environmental humanities? Students will write frequent reflections, develop several short papers, and the semester will culminate in the construction of a final project of the student\u2019s own design (for example, a research paper, a website, a podcast\u2026) that can focus on any aspect of academic, professional, or political argumentation."

    "description": "In recent years, the U.S. legal system has been beset by claims of overcriminalization, racially discriminatory enforcement, and inadequate or unequal protection of individual civil rights. What should we make of these claims, and what, if anything, would be implied by their truth? In seeking to answer these questions, this course will examine the nature of the law and its enforcement. We will begin by discussing the issue of criminalization and whether the expansion of the criminal law is or is not problematic. From there, we will turn to the foundational questions of what, precisely, the law is, and what its connection to morality is or should be. Are we obligated to obey the law, and if so, why? Finally, we will ask whether it is possible for the law to remain neutral with regards to morality and politics, and whether the supposed \u201cneutrality\u201d of the law may itself be an instrument of oppression. If the legal system lacks the kind of neutrality that many legal theorists claim for it, what (if anything) does that license us (as citizens) to do?\u00a0(Offered every spring)"

    "description": "The 20th century was defined by humanity\u2019s ability to invent a pill, vaccine, or device to overcome our biggest challenges. As the recent COVID pandemic makes clear, those days are not over entirely. But, also well illustrated by our experience with COVID, the most serious threats to human health and well-being now and for the foreseeable future are largely driven by individual and collective behavior choices we all make every day\u2014whether we maintain healthy diets, wear face masks, save for retirement, persist in school, put our phones away while driving, use energy and other resources responsibly, and adhere to basic ethical standards. Consequently, behavioral science has emerged as a major new frontier in the policy sphere. Behavioral science leverages a sophisticated understanding of the psychology that drives people\u2019s decisions to influence individual behavioral choices in ways that benefit individuals, the organizations they are part of, and/or the broader society. This course is intended to prepare you to apply principles of behavioral science to better understand and address the behaviors you care about in contexts you are interested in. To do so, this course will involve weekly reading, active engagement in (and facilitation of) class discussions, and midterm and final projects that will require you to apply behavioral science to propose feasible solutions to pressing real-world issues. Prerequisites:  PSYC 101 and one of the following STAT courses: STAT 180, STAT 190, STAT 212, or STAT 213."

    "description": "In recent years, intervention science has emerged as an influential area of psychological research. Rooted in diverse theories and methods that date as far back as Kurt Lewin\u2019s pioneering work in the early 20th century, intervention science applies psychological principles to influence people\u2019s beliefs and behavior in ways that benefit them, the organizations they are part of, and/or the broader society. In doing so, it yields practicable solutions to challenging social problems while also informing theory in ways that complement correlational and laboratory methods. In this course, we will learn about (a) the unique intellectual tradition that shapes how intervention scientists think, (b) the theoretical perspectives and frameworks that undergird the design of effective interventions, (c) intervention methods that have been successful in changing real-world outcomes, and (d) methods to design and evaluate these types of interventions. The primary outcome of this course will be a detailed proposal for an intervention that addresses an issue or question in your specific area of study and thus builds on your existing area of research. To accomplish this goal, this course will consist of weekly readings, active engagement in (and facilitation of) class discussions, and midterm and final projects in which you will use principles from the course to propose psychological interventions that address pressing societal issues. These elements are designed to reinforce one another and help you hone a strong skillset in the development and evaluation of social-psychological interventions."

In Freud\u2019s early works, he portrayed religion as a \u201ccollective neurosis of mankind\u201d arguing that religious beliefs serve the fulfill the immature psychological and emotional needs of the child within the adult self. Therefore, he firmly advocated for replacing these illusions with a more scientific and materialistic attitude that would be based on science and impassioned observation. However, signaling a dramatic change in Freud\u2019s attitude, his later works present religion as critical for the wellbeing of society and even vital for its survival.

Students will explore the relationship between text and image, how scholars approach illustrated narrative, and how historical developments shape the formation of illustrated narrative and are in turn shaped by these combinations of text and image.

Coincidence or not, the war has catapulted Zelensky to the world stage and is inextricably part of how history will remember him. The entire biography of Vladimir Zelensky as an actor, politician, father, and husband can be recounted in an hour. It seems more interesting to us to understand how he rehabilitated the creative intelligentsia, proving that an actor and producer can be an outstanding leader of a country. Our task is to trace the formation of a special type of king-narrator, a king-storyteller, who gives the population of the country a plot of existence, a goal and meaning, while professionals deal with economics, defense, and diplomacy. We can trace this type already in the biography of Donald Trump, as Zelensky himself has repeatedly stated. But the signs of this type\u2014a writer, actor, showman, or scientist at the head of a country\u2014we have already seen many times, from the unsuccessful experience of Nero to the triumphant experience of Reagan.

    "title": "Dangerous Texts",
    "description": "When modern Russian literature began to evolve in the mid-1600s, the printed or written text was immediately seen as a potential danger to the power of Church and State. In this course we will examine dangerous texts from the 17th century to the present to see what aspects of texts and their authors were seen as threats and how these threats were dealt with. We will also see the ways in which writers did indeed perceive themselves as a \u2018second government\u2019 and how this changed the way they wrote. The main problem with censorship is that sooner or later it has to be abolished, and then there is a great temptation to destroy the entire state power as a whole. This happened in Russia in 1905 and 1989. The danger of the texts of Russian writers is not that they destroy the state, but that the authorities begin to ban them and commit inevitable suicidal stupidities. Not every politically courageous text becomes dangerous. The authorities react only to what encroaches on the very foundations of slavery - the problems of prisons, patriarchal dependence, and the territorial unity of Russia, that is, everything that defines in the eyes of the authorities its \u201csovereignty.\u201d The goal of this course is to arrive at an understanding of the unique role played by literature in Russian history.

Coincidence or not, the war has catapulted Zelensky to the world stage and is inextricably part of how history will remember him. The entire biography of Vladimir Zelensky as an actor, politician, father, and husband can be recounted in an hour. It seems more interesting to us to understand how he rehabilitated the creative intelligentsia, proving that an actor and producer can be an outstanding leader of a country. Our task is to trace the formation of a special type of king-narrator, a king-storyteller, who gives the population of the country a plot of existence, a goal and meaning, while professionals deal with economics, defense, and diplomacy. We can trace this type already in the biography of Donald Trump, as Zelensky himself has repeatedly stated. But the signs of this type\u2014a writer, actor, showman, or scientist at the head of a country\u2014we have already seen many times, from the unsuccessful experience of Nero to the triumphant experience of Reagan. We will analyze the cases of the writer D'Annunzio, the journalist Mussolini, the novelist and painter Churchill, the playwright Havel, the poets Mao Zedong and Andropov. And, of course, we will tell in detail how the comic actor and stand-up artist Vladimir Zelensky turned into one of the leaders of the free world. Taught in English."

    "title": "Russian Movies that Rock",
    "description": "In the decade preceding the collapse of the USSR, rock music became a galvanizing force for change and an enduring commodity for the last Soviet generation. The traditionally western musical genre, often maligned by the establishment for its alleged propaganda of anti-socialist ideology, quickly infiltrated everyday life in the USSR and, subsequently, other art forms; most notably, the highly regimented Soviet film industry. This course will examine the representation of rock music in Soviet, post-Soviet and contemporary Russian cinema and will raise questions about he ways in which film popular music engages with sociopolitical events and acts as a destabilizing agent for totalitarianism. Taught in English."

    "title": "Dangerous Texts",
    "description": "When modern Russian literature began to evolve in the mid-1600s, the printed or written text was immediately seen as a potential danger to the power of Church and State. In this course we will examine dangerous texts from the 17th century to the present to see what aspects of texts and their authors were seen as threats and how these threats were dealt with. We will also see the ways in which writers did indeed perceive themselves as a \u2018second government\u2019 and how this changed the way they wrote. The main problem with censorship is that sooner or later it has to be abolished, and then there is a great temptation to destroy the entire state power as a whole. This happened in Russia in 1905 and 1989. The danger of the texts of Russian writers is not that they destroy the state, but that the authorities begin to ban them and commit inevitable suicidal stupidities. Not every politically courageous text becomes dangerous. The authorities react only to what encroaches on the very foundations of slavery - the problems of prisons, patriarchal dependence, and the territorial unity of Russia, that is, everything that defines in the eyes of the authorities its \u201csovereignty.\u201d The goal of this course is to arrive at an understanding of the unique role played by literature in Russian history.

How the Habsburgs transformed Madrid as their imperial city, how Gaud\u00ed pictured a workers\u2019 paradise, what modernity meant for both cities before and after the dictatorship, how the cities have adapted geographies to necessities, how tourist consumers have changed the configuration of Spanish cities, where immigrants call home, and the fusion of aesthetics and functionality in contemporary architectural constructions. From the re-envisioning of Barajas as gateway, to a slaughterhouse become a cultural megaplex, and from industrial corridor to regional modernisme Barcelona and Madrid will be our focus from the perspective of the streets (a ras de tierra).

Is it okay to destroy embryos for stem cell research? Is active euthanasia ever permissible? Is capital punishment justifiable in principle? In practice? Is torture morally permissible in the fight against terrorism? How far does our moral duty to aid distant strangers extend? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means? Are there objective facts about right or wrong, or is morality ultimately relative to cultures or times? Are there situations in which every available action is wrong? Can we be morally assessed even for some things that are largely a matter of luck?"

The course typically covers the following:\u00a0The difference between computable and uncomputable problems and between feasible and infeasible problems. Regarding the latter, what properties of a problem make it computationally simple? What properties of a problem may preclude its having efficient algorithms? How computationally hard are problems? Complete sets and low information content; P=NP?; characterizing whether one-way functions exist; reductions relating problems' complexities; complexity classes and hierarchies."

The course offers instruction in small sections that focus on the act of writing. It provides instruction and practice in clear and effective writing and in constructing cogent and compelling arguments, as students draft and revise numerous compositions of different forms and lengths. These assignments introduce some of the genres students are expected to produce later in their college careers as well as in their public and professional lives after graduation. The subject of the course is writing, but since writing is about something, each section of WRTG 105 focuses on a unique theme. Within this theme, students analyze, discuss, and engage with a range of texts in order to construct their own arguments and a final argumentative research paper. Students consider the roles of audience and purpose in shaping the organization, style and argumentative strategies of their papers, and they learn to become self-aware readers of their writing through reflection, peer response, revision, and editing. All sections include writing instruction, workshops, and practice in core writing principles and strategies needed to meet the course learning objectives and to become successful writers in and beyond college."

In this class, we will hone our communication and argument skills through the lens of citizenship. We will explore the notion of citizenship through a variety of texts. For example, we will think about how Fredrick Douglass\u2019s autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom tussles with the right to vote as being so crucial to citizenship. We will also consider how the TV show Scandal and Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s short stories showcase citizenship through their own lenses. Theoretical texts will include Judith Shklar\u2019s American Citizenship: The Quest for Inclusion and Laurent Berlant\u2019s The Queen of America goes to Washington City. These materials and our class discussion will inform our research questions, and formal and informal writing assignments will allow us to develop our writing skills. Through writer reflection, peer feedback and revision which each formal assignment incorporates, we will improve our abilities of writing cohesively and persuasively. The 8-10 pages argumentative research paper addressing class themes will demonstrate our ability of writing for an academic audience.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

This course aims to instill an understanding of the basic principles of academic writing by analyzing questions like these from a variety of intellectual perspectives. Spanning the fields of psychology, philosophy, political science, computer science, and linguistics, our investigation will center around the values at stake in communicating with others. To stimulate the process of drafting, peer feedback, reflection, and revision, we will engage with scholarly texts such as N.J.

    "description": "Whether immersed in fiction, enshrined in architecture, resting in the annals of myth, detailed in a bestiary, or hiding under our childhood beds, monsters are everywhere. Monstrous narratives are used to teach children to behave; monster narratives are also used to explore good and evil, our connection with nature, or our relationship with fear and the unknown. In this course, students will be tasked with exploring their own relationship with monsters through writing, critical analysis and argument. Students will discuss and reflect on the role monsters play in different media; these discussions will be further refined through short formal papers and informal response pieces. Students will revise the formal papers through self-reflection and peer feedback. Our subjects will be drawn from mythology, excerpts from literature such as Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula and Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, monsters in film and television like Lord of the Rings or Spirited Away, games like Monster Hunter and Dungeons & Dragons as well as scholarly articles like Boyer\u2019s \u201cThe Anatomy of a Monster: The Case of Slender Man.\" Using the course theme, students will compose an 8\u201310-page argumentative research paper, using the same process of reflection and feedback as the shorter formal papers.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

Can utopian communities ever be sustainable? Through our inquiry, discussion, and writing, we will explore these questions and investigate the concept of utopia more broadly. To do so, we will encounter fictional utopias through speculative literature, learn about global utopian communities through academic and popular sources like articles and podcasts, and consider philosophical writings on utopia. We will read\u00a0\u201cSultana\u2019s Dream\u201d\u00a0by Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, stories by Ursula Le Guin and N.K. Jemisin, and scholarly works by Lyman Tower Sargent and others. In informal and formal writing assignments, students will respond creatively and critically to these works and to each other, writing reflections and developing arguments to enter into the larger conversation. Formal assignments, including an 8-10 page argumentative research paper, will involve peer feedback, revision, and writer-reflection. Through these endeavors, students will learn and apply the conventions of academic writing. Students are also invited to explore questions of utopia through any disciplines that they are familiar with or interested in such as technology, art, and biology, to name just a few.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

Sharing stories is fundamental in shaping identity, but what does it mean to be queer and/or trans* when narrating an experience? What does it mean to inherit the trauma of the past? How can a reclamation of coded identity be invoked? When does storytelling end and living begin? Through a series of formal and informal assignments, peer review, writer reflection, and a final 8-10 page argumentative research paper, we will begin to understand the boundaries of space and time in queer and trans* narratives. We will examine and apply the rhetorical style of writing with academics like Rossenwasser, Booth, and Ballinger to answer an authentic research question. We will also critically examine LGBTQIA+ history and the untold or often overlooked stories using visual media, the written word, and social media. As we walk this temporal path, we will engage with scholars like Eve Sedgwick, Sara Ahmed, and Teagan Bradway to interrogate what it means to claim space as queer and trans* individuals.

Whether defined as \u201ca number of things\u201d or \u201ca collective body or unit,\u201d how do we make meaning of those definitions in relation to us? How might writing be used to further understand the multitudes contained within us? We\u2019ll explore these questions from an array of literary, philosophical, sociological, and psychological perspectives. Using America (a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of cultures and collectives) as our setting, we\u2019ll discuss major socially-constructed categories\u2014such as race, gender, and class\u2014and the ways writers define and defy those categories through their writing. The texts we\u2019ll analyze and write about range from individual, personal experiences in America to manuscripts examining the country on a broader scale; examples include excerpts of Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cSong of Myself\u201d (1892) and Gloria Anzaldua\u2019s La Frontera to Childish Gambino\u2019s \u201cThis is America\u201d (2018) to Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\u2019s Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (2022).

First, how does the type of activity and the space in which it takes place shape an understanding of Nature and humanity\u2019s relation to it? Second, how does an activity relate to sociopolitical forces like capitalism or colonialism?To explore these questions, you will read and write about a range of outdoor activities, including hiking, forest bathing, and urban exploration. You will read about famous 19th-century naturalists like John Muir, and about modern-day \u201cski bums\u201d and \u201cdirt bag\u201d climbers. You will watch films about epic cross-country adventures (Into the Wild), and films about finding adventure in your backyard (Beau Miles). Additionally, you will read what sociologists, psychologists and historians have said about our topic.A requirement will be to spend one hour per week outside. Reflecting on these activities in discussions and short essays, you will develop responses to the course\u2019s guiding question. This culminates in an argumentative, 8-10 page research project in which you will plan, research, and document your own outdoor adventure.

As we inhabit and shape space, we infuse it with layers of meaning. If you wish to unravel meanings behind the cityscapes of Rochester, this course is one way in. No special background is needed; any scholarly perspectives on urban sprawl can guide your inquiry.First, adopting walking ethnographic interview by Evans & Jones 2011, we run a short pilot study on a campus spot together, trying out a range of lenses, e.g., what happens if we take on a tourist gaze following sociologist Urry, or give it a visual spin relying on art historian Berger or consider exclusion of the poor inspired by social cartographer Vaughn? These early explorations involve some short formal and informal writing. Then, the students apply the method to individually explore a Rochester site of choice. Thus, the pilot study is transformed into an 8-10 page argumentative research paper. Through drafting and redrafting, writer\u2019s reflections, peer responses and engaging with sources on urban cityscape, we arrive at a compilation of our research papers on the local urban gems.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

How do we perform identity when we play? How are games impacting social change and behavior? Students will raise authentic questions as they write about games from a variety of lenses: design, narrative, psychology, gender, genre, and more. We will not only play video games as primary texts, but also discuss, analyze, evaluate, and write about our interactions with and stances towards video games. Our work will involve writing exercises, multimodal elements, peer feedback, formal essays, reflection, revision, and a supportive writing environment.

We will consider a range of sources on language and body; e.g. whether vulnerability is at the heart of courage (psychology, Brown 2018), whether anything is conveyed through touch (tactile communication, Classen 2020) and whether silence or lack of movement are tough to interpret (cultural studies, Donahue 2020). To reflect on an emotion of your choice, the students produce an informal podcast. The podcast exchange will open research questions.

    "description": "Who are we? Why are we here? What, after all, is human nature? As a species, we have long wondered what drives us, what makes us unique, why we are the way we are. In this class, we will examine the question of human nature from various perspectives, including science, religion, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and animal studies. We will analyze these viewpoints using writing, critical reading, and discussion, drawing from authors like Edward O. Wilson, Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Foucault, Charles Darwin, and William James, as well as texts ranging from academic scholarship and popular journalism to fiction and film. Students will take part in informal writing, peer response, writer reflection, and revision. The course will culminate in an 8-10 page argumentative research paper.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

    "description": "In this course, we will explore how the synergy of writing, photography, and AI enhances storytelling and creative expression. We will engage with two pivotal questions: How do photography and writing, each with its unique way of capturing and depicting reality, interweave to complement one another? And, in what ways does AI redefine the boundaries, potentialities, and intersections of these creative expressions? You will explore on-campus/online exhibitions, take photos in photo walks around the campus, and write formal and informal papers such as photo essays, blogs, etc. Readings will include texts such as On Writing with Photography by Beckman and Weissberg and The Perception Machine: Our Photographic Future between the Eye and AI by Joanna Zylinska. You will also explore how notable photojournalists and AI artists, like Graeme Green and Boris Eldagsen, use these mediums for their creative and professional pursuits. As you reflect on these activities in discussions and writings, you will develop your own response to the issues pertaining to the course theme. This will culminate in an 8-10-page argumentative final research paper. The formal assignments, including the research paper, will undergo peer feedback, reflection, and revision before submission.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

In the wide genre of \"time warp\" stories, characters relive the same day, travel back and forth in time, experience events out of sync and challenge our assumptions about the world, history, and ourselves. But how exactly do these stories work? What makes them so popular? How do they reflect and revise our perspectives? We will explore the motives, tools, and opportunities involved in constructing time travel narratives from expressions in ancient folklore to modern fiction, film, and music. Course texts include views of time and narrative from a variety of scholarly fields, alongside H. G. Well's The Time Machine, Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, and Makoto Shinkai's Your Name.

First, how does the type of activity and the space in which it takes place shape an understanding of Nature and humanity\u2019s relation to it? Second, how does an activity relate to sociopolitical forces like capitalism or colonialism?To explore these questions, you will read and write about a range of outdoor activities, including hiking, forest bathing, and urban exploration. You will read about famous 19th-century naturalists like John Muir, and about modern-day \u201cski bums\u201d and \u201cdirt bag\u201d climbers.

In this course, students select a work (or works) of fantasy literature about which to write, exploring connections with a social or scientific issue present in the real world, and developing their ability to engage meaningfully with the world via writing. Students will examine their own critical writing process while engaging with Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord of the Rings, N.K. Jemisin\u2019s The Ones Who Stay and Fight, Hajime Isayama\u2019s Attack on Titan, CD Projekt\u2019s The Witcher 3, and other works in the fantasy genre. Students can also expect to read critical articles centered on fantasy by prominent thinkers like Verlyn Flieger and J.R.R. Tolkien. In their own process, students may choose to incorporate approaches from ecology, anthropology, psychology, and/or other disciplines. By integrating strategies such as structured revision, personal reflection, peer response, and more, the course allows students to develop their critical writing and communication abilities while exploring how reality shapes fantasy (and vice versa!).

Scholars in science, economics, and anthropology approach friendship as both socially and biologically valuable, studying its role in evolutionary survival, consumerism, social bonding, and community. How does friendship affect how we cooperate and compete, spend our money, and forge kinship? Students will explore such questions as a way of developing their own inquiries into friendship\u2019s place in shaping personal and social identity. Course texts will include a range of scholarly articles; \"Struggle for Existence\" by Charles Darwin; \"It's Who You Know\" by John Terrell; \"People Who Can Be Friends: Selves and Social Relationships\" by James G.

How does it allow us to interact with the world through sensory input and active output as we think, speak, and write? What happens in the brain when we shift between these everyday tasks? In this course, we will explore how these intertwined functions compare cognitively and how each contributes to communication from neurological, cognitive, and behavioral perspectives. The works of Steven Pinker, V. S. Ramachandran, as well as other scholarly and popular sources will be investigated through informal and formal writing experiences. This course emphasizes the importance of the writing process through writer-reflection, peer feedback, and revision. The culmination is an 8 to 10 page research paper where you will develop an argument that is informed by your perspective and the existing research.

    "description": "Since its rise to popularity in the 1990s with hit shows like The Real World and Big Brother, reality TV has captured the attention\u2013and often the outrage\u2013of audiences worldwide. Few would argue that popular reality shows like Naked and Afraid or Kitchen Nightmares reflect reality as most people experience it. What is it, then, that these shows do reflect? Put another way: what is the relationship between this genre and the reality it claims to represent? In this course, we will approach this central question through watching, discussing, reading about, and writing about reality TV. In the process, students will draft, revise, reflect and, ultimately, learn to effectively express ideas and defend arguments about mass culture, consumerism, postmodernity, and more. They will hear from thinkers ranging from 20th-century philosophers like Guy Debord and Theodore Adorno to contemporary journalists like Aubrey Gordon and Michael Hobbes. As the semester unfolds, students will explore, develop, and refine their ideas through formal and informal assignments culminating in an 8-10-page argumentative research paper. Each assignment constitutes an opportunity for students to engage further with a course-related topic that they find particularly perplexing, compelling, or\u2013perhaps\u2013outraging.To fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of C or higher."

Should human enhancement technologies be controlled by parents or by governments? Should humanity strive to throw off the constraints of biological existence for something else entirely? What are genetic \"diseases\" and should we try to eliminate them? We will use the tools of research, writing, argument, and discussion to hone our views on these complex issues and learn to communicate our conclusions through writing. Students will develop a few short analytical and argumentative essays before working on an 8-10 page argumentative research essay.

Students will explore questions such as these by using writing as a tool for inquiry, discovery, and knowledge construction. In constructing new knowledge, students will also learn how to navigate ethical issues around proper attribution of ideas, as this is important to both writers and engineers. Class discussions, readings, and informal assignments will work together to inform the drafting and revision of two short argumentative essays, an 8-10 page research paper, and a multimodal composition for a public audience.

Experts are sometimes wrong, the data can be misleading or, more radically, we could be living in a Descartes-style massive delusion where our experiences do not match up to reality at all. In this class, we\u2019ll use writing to investigate the role of uncertainty in academic research and our everyday lives. We\u2019ll ask general questions such as: If certainty and knowledge are not synonymous, what is the value of certainty? Is certainty something to be sought after or avoided? How do certainty and uncertainty function in research across the humanities, social, and natural sciences? We will begin with immersive virtual reality experiences to test our senses of certainty. We will engage with a range of popular sources, including a podcast about Lyme disease and the scientific process, and work through research, primarily from philosophy and psychology, on knowledge, experience, and information exchange.

Is it possible for the work of experts to be corrupt, biased, or philosophically misguided? When are outsiders of an academic field intellectually justified in criticizing the conclusions of insiders? How can we distinguish legitimate criticism of authority from that which results from ignorance, paranoia, vested interest, or political bias? The readings for this course will include passages from works like Naomi Oreskes\u2019s and Erik M.

What happens when aesthetic choices encourage audiences to sympathize with an unsympathetic character, or a \u201cmoral monster\u201d (Humbert Humbert from Lolita, for example)? Is it possible to think of sympathy without aesthetics? What are the social consequences that result from the connection between aesthetics and sympathy?

One thing is clear though: both the teacher and the student think that attention matters because attention determines which object is more important at a given point of time. How then do we come to decide on our objects of attention and how does that decision influence our relations to the world? We will explore these two primary questions via fictional works by Conan Doyle, Antoine de Saint-Exupery; and philosophical and psychological works by William James, Iris Murdoch, among others.

Students will learn to develop the ability to see patterns in grammar, as well as its structural possibilities and limits. Assignments will regularly involve reflection on form, usage and speaker judgments. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of an English variety available to them. Throughout, students will be working with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammatical structures or yield ungrammaticality.

How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications.Prerequisite: Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement."

Students can draw on pre-existing research interests from their majors or develop a line of inquiry stemming from class discussions, writing, and research. In order to gain experience writing to a range of readers, students will engage in a writing process informed by peer review, self-assessment, and revision. Shorter writing assignments will help students develop and refine ideas as they transform texts for different audiences. The final research project will be multimodal, published for a public audience, and should demonstrate your ability to think critically about a topic and effectively communicate that knowledge to a range of readers.Prerequisite: Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement."

You will develop a technical vocabulary and set of skills that allow you to describe recurring patterns and writer choices within those patterns. Using these tools, and talking to experts in your chosen discipline(s), you will investigate disciplinary and interdisciplinary boundaries, how writers convey meaning in different situations, and why they make the writing choices they do.

What do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? For instance, is there common ground in how we argue about English literature and how biologists argue about the natural world? How do audience and purpose in disciplines such as psychology, physics and philosophy shape what counts as an argument in their respective fields? Does political argument resemble academic argument? What strategies will enable experts to communicate more effectively with public audiences in fields such as public health and the environmental humanities? Students will write frequent reflections, develop several short papers, and the semester will culminate in the construction of a final project of the student\u2019s own design (for example, a research paper, a website, a podcast\u2026) that can focus on any aspect of academic, professional, or political argumentation."

In this course, we will explore a variety of AI tools with the goal of understanding how these tools might fit into the writing process and where the possible pitfalls lie. We\u2019ll learn how to interpret articles about AI in the media with a critical eye and discuss what would be necessary for media to do a better job of writing about AI. But we\u2019ll also experiment with AI tools to explore what it means to write with AI. Throughout the semester, we\u2019ll dive deeper into what it is that we humans do when we write, from brainstorming all the way through final drafts, and we\u2019ll probe what happens when we add AI to the mix at each of those stages in a series of reflective assignments. These will build towards a final project in which students offer a research-based proposal for a specific way in which AI could be effectively and ethically used by writers."
